There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR ( United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation - related health effects to most people exposed .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following :,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions , and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation .",NPN,english
"Many people still believe that to be true , even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence , Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters ( EMERCOM of Russia ) reported this in 1996 :",NPN,english
CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT : TEN YEARS ON,NPN,english

The prestigious IAEA ( International Atomic Energy Agency ) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"However , in April 2001 , the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned . which contradict the earlier reports .",NPN,english

"The dramatic increase in radiation - induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine , which have been observed since 1991 , continues to this day .",NPN,english
"... a drop in the birth rate , a deterioration in women's women 's reproductive health , an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth , and a deterioration in neonatal health ....",NPN,english
"The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus , Russia , and Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies : the morbidity rate is going up , the number of really healthy children is dropping , and disability is increasing .",NPN,english

What do the new al - Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2 / 3s of the top 25 al - Qaeda commanders , the middle managers are not in close contact with al - Zawahiri and Bin Laden .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
The tape was a way to signal priorities .,NPN,english
"These are 1 ) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the Pakistani military "" president "" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al - Qaeda .",NPN,english
Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al - Qaeda sympathizers .,NPN,english
"His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad , as well as nearly 500 other al - Qaeda operatives , over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US .",NPN,english
"Musharraf held elections in October of 2002 , in which center - right parties did well , but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition , MMA .",NPN,english
"MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province , which probably shelters Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province , also on the Afghanistan border .",NPN,english
"If al - Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers , they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations , which is also a nuclear power .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"All this is highly unlikely , as with most al - Qaeda crackpot schemes .",NPN,english
But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Response : The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"On the one hand , it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election , and to repeal the contentious "" Legal Framework Order "" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship .",NPN,english
"On the other , restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League - N and Pakistan People's People 's Party , who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"On the other hand , the US should strong - arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue .",NPN,english
Al - Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf's Musharraf 's lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow .,NPN,english
"The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism , and even the threat of nuclear war , than Iraq ever did .",NPN,english
2 ) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government .,NPN,english
"Response : The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas , and started the process of cutting off its funding .",NPN,english
This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks .,NPN,english
It should continue to be defanged .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"But Sharon's Sharon 's iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace , and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza .",NPN,english
"Sharon's Sharon 's hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas's Hamas 's terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further , which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al - Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States .",NPN,english
"Israel owes the United States at least this much , in this crisis , to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace .",NPN,english
"3 ) Make Iraq another Afghanistan , using the Republican Right's Right 's own tactics against them .",NPN,english
"Response : Iraq is actually hostile territory for al - Qaeda , and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot can not succeed there .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives , the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side , so that they turn in the foreigners .",NPN,english
"Certainly , the Shiites already hate al - Qaeda and would help ; likewise the Kurds .",NPN,english

Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn't is n't nearly as good a rallying cry for al - Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out .,NPN,english
"The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al - Qaeda infiltrators , and it would be dangerous to take one's one 's eyes off the former ball .",NPN,english
George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

"Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military's military 's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir , so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger .",NPN,english

Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

India defensive over Sri Lanka,NPN,english

NEW DELHI -,Resultative,english
"While India is ready to enter into a "" defense cooperation agreement "" with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation's nation 's two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides .",Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,english
And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga's Kumaratunga 's four - day visit to India recently .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"According to Professor S D Muni , South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University , the two - year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) are stalemated .",NPN,english
"For that reason , he said , Kumaratunga's Kumaratunga 's government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support .",NPN,english

"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive , "" Muni told IPS .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003 .,NPN,english
"But last April , the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition , first , for the right to self - rule before proceeding any further .",NPN,english
Kumaratunga's Kumaratunga 's India tour preceded a three - day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002 .,NPN,english
"Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success , and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed - door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track , diplomatic sources said .",NPN,english
"But they , too , failed .",Resultative,english
"Colombo , too , seems to be in an intractable position .",NPN,english
"According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat , the difficulty for Kumaratunga's Kumaratunga 's government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control .",NPN,english
A veteran of India's India 's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment .,NPN,english
"Kalkat , who currently chairs the independent US - based International Council on Conflict Resolution , said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers , India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks .",NPN,english
""" The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [ unlike India ] to underwrite any arrangement , "" Kalkat told IPS in an interview .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"In 1987 , the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure .",NPN,english
"Under the accord , a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east .",NPN,english
"However , differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa , a strong critic of Indian mediation .",NPN,english
"Last June , an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$ 4.5 billion .",NPN,english
"Japan's Japan 's special envoy , Yasushi Akashi , who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released , came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man .",NPN,english
"He complained about the "" visible lack of progress "" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides .",NPN,english
"The Tigers' Tigers ' chief ideologue , Balasingham , sniffed at the proposal saying that "" a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot can not be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences , but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces . """,NPN,english

"She added that recent visits to the island by India's India 's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "" caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island "" .",NPN,english
"But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill - advised to be involved again , militarily , with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka's Lanka 's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

"So just for the record , here , in full , is what Bush did :",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
The future president joined the Guard in May 1968 .,NPN,english

Did you know that ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “ deserted ” ( according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore ) or went “ AWOL ” ( according to Terry McAuliffe , chairman of the Democratic National Committee ) .",NPN,english
Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign .,NPN,english

"Then , in 1973 , as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School , he again started showing up frequently .",NPN,english
"In June and July of 1973 , he accumulated 56 points , enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973 - 1974 year .",NPN,english
"Then , at his request , he was given permission to go .",NPN,english
"Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years , four months and five days of his original six - year commitment .",NPN,english
"By that time , however , he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service .",NPN,english

However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI .,NPN,english
At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan .,NPN,english
"Not only is the army facing serious political fallout , growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties - between 400 - 500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan .,NPN,english
That too may change .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts .,NPN,english
"Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders , who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections , the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home .",NPN,english

Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban .,NPN,english
Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt. General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief .,NPN,english
Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues .,NPN,english
Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan .,NPN,english

Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream .,NPN,english
Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

"With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan , Iran’s Iran ’s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced .",NPN,english

"Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand , a massive Soviet - era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran’s Iran ’s border .",NPN,english
"The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan , the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month , who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners .",NPN,english
Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan’s Khan ’s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai’s Karzai ’s campaign against warlords .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s Iran ’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively , the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post , spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran .",NPN,english
Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand .,NPN,english
However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran .,NPN,english
"‘’ We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters , ’’ says Barno .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english

"Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
It is a very potent psychological weapon .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Its real direct impact is relatively minor .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya - based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq .,NPN,english
So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
It creates headlines .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
It is spectacular .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
It is frightening .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
It is always shown on television in great detail .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .",NPN,english
But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .,NPN,english
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .,NPN,english
"The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder , not the next one .",NPN,english
We may arrange for the best airport security in the world .,NPN,english
"But if you want to murder by suicide , you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses .,NPN,english
"Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters , concert halls , supermarkets , shopping malls , schools and hospitals .",NPN,english
"Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .,NPN,english
And it is a war !,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
What is behind the suicide murders ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .",NPN,english
It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .,NPN,english
No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
No relative of anyone influential has done it .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Wouldn't Would n't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Aren't Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .",NPN,english
"They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .",NPN,english
Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .,NPN,english
"The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .",NPN,english
It never happens there .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .",NPN,english
"There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer's Bremmer 's Iraq , and no one exploded himself .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .",NPN,english
"The only way to fight this new "" popular "" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way .",NPN,english
"Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .",NPN,english
You cannot can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .,NPN,english
"You must go after the head of the "" Family "" .",NPN,english
"If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"The United States understands this now , after September 11 .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Russia is beginning to understand it .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Turkey understands it well .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Unfortunately , it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen .",NPN,english
The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning .,NPN,english
The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies . *",NPN,english
Words can be lethal .,NPN,english
They kill people .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"It is often said that politicians , diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie , as part of their professional life .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish , in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications , which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about .",NPN,english
"An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened , or was an American provocation or , even better , a Jewish plot .",NPN,english
"You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information , Mr. Mouhamad Said al - Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic .,NPN,english
"But to stand , day after day , and to make such preposterous statements , known to everybody to be lies , without even being ridiculed in your own milieu , can only happen in this region .",NPN,english
"Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester , but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time .",NPN,english
"It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence , every day , even now , to similar liars .",NPN,english
"After all , if you want to be an anti-Semite , there are subtle ways of doing it .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened , and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed .",NPN,english
But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"When these same leaders make other statements , the Western media report them as if they could be true .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance , arm and dispatch suicide murderers , condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras , talking to a world audience , which even partly believes them .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Incitement by Arab TV , accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies , has become a powerful weapon of those who lie , distort and want to destroy everything .",NPN,english
"Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so - called martyrs , and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows .",NPN,english
"I recommend to you , even though most of you do not understand Arabic , to watch Al Jazeera , from time to time .",NPN,english
You will not believe your own eyes .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"But words also work in other ways , more subtle .",NPN,english
"A demonstration in Berlin , carrying banners supporting Saddam's Saddam 's regime and featuring three - year old babies dressed as suicide murderers , is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "" peace demonstration "" .",NPN,english
"You may support or oppose the Iraq war , but to refer to fans of Saddam , Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much .",NPN,english
"A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day , eats , observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill .",NPN,english
"She then blows herself up , killing 20 people , including many children , with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant .",NPN,english
"She is called "" martyr "" by several Arab leaders and called "" activist "" by the European press .",NPN,english
Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows .,NPN,english
"There is a new game in town : The actual murderer is called "" the military wing "" , the one who pays him , equips him and sends him is now called "" the political wing "" and the head of the operation is called the "" spiritual leader "" .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature , used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
These words are much more dangerous than many people realize .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
He is now being outperformed by his successors .,NPN,english
* 3 . The third aspect is money . *,NPN,english
"Huge amounts of money , which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world , are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder .",NPN,english
In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves .,NPN,english
"The money funds their travel , explosives , hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets .",NPN,english
"The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria , until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes .",NPN,english
"These states , as well as the Palestinian Authority , are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors .",NPN,english
"They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters , planners , commanders , preachers , all of whom make a living , usually a very comfortable living , by serving as terror infrastructure .",NPN,english
"Finally , we find the third circle of so - called religious , educational and welfare organizations , which actually do some good , feed the hungry and provide some schooling , but brainwash a new generation with hatred , lies and ignorance .",NPN,english
"This circle operates mostly through mosques , madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media .",NPN,english
"It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior , that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world , for the miseries of the region .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia , but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and , to a smaller extent , by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations , whose goals may be noble , but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle .",NPN,english
"The Saudi regime , of course , will be the next victim of major terror , when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The Saudis are beginning to understand it , but they fight the inner circles , while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Figuratively speaking , this outer circle is the guardian , which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement , rather than to the world outside .",NPN,english
"Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from , or blackmail by , the inner circles .",NPN,english
The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20 , the most receptive age to incitement , guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred .",NPN,english
Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot .,NPN,english
"You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe , not in the training camps of suicide murderers .",NPN,english
"The Jihad "" soldiers "" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots , while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Mrs. Arafat , who lives in Paris with her daughter , receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority , while a typical local ringleader of the Al - Aksa brigade , reporting to Arafat , receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars , for performing murders at the retail level .",NPN,english
* 4 . The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws . *,NPN,english
"The civilized world believes in democracy , the rule of law , including international law , human rights , free speech and free press , among other liberties .",NPN,english
"There are naive old - fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols , not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war , avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Never in history , not even in the Nazi period , was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations .,NPN,english
Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Does free speech protect you when you shout "" fire "" in a crowded theater ?",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders ?",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
These are the old - fashioned dilemmas .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
But now we have an entire new set .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage ?",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital ?",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you , standing deliberately behind a group of children ?",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital ?",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas .,NPN,english
What do you do ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"Well , you do not want to face the dilemma .",NPN,english
But it cannot can not be avoided .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .",NPN,english
"I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done , in such a situation .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .,NPN,english
It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .,NPN,english
"In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as "" war criminals , "" with some Western media repeating the allegations .",NPN,english
"The good news is that all of this is temporary , because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .",NPN,english
"After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .",NPN,english
"But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
The picture I described here is not pretty .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
What can we do about it ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"In the short run , only fight and win .",NPN,english
"In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .",NPN,english
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .,NPN,english
The outer circle cannot can not be eliminated by force .,NPN,english
"Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .",NPN,english
"Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .",NPN,english
"Allow me , for a moment , to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science .",NPN,english
"When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english

"If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"In order to win , it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes , so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"I do not want to comment here on whether the American - led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument , but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Now that Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya are out , two and a half terrorist states remain : Iran , Syria and Lebanon , the latter being a Syrian colony .",NPN,english
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list .,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq , both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them .",NPN,english
"Iran is encircled by Afghanistan , by the Gulf States , Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union .",NPN,english
"Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .",NPN,english
This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria , but that is the resulting situation .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .",NPN,english
It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .,NPN,english
It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
It is ruthless .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "" good - cop versus bad - cop "" game .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism , it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq , it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .",NPN,english
"Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .",NPN,english
In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .,NPN,english
"It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .",NPN,english
"It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Above all , never surrender to terror .",NPN,english
"No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result , if not for the train bombings a few days earlier .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
But it really does not matter .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .",NPN,english
"In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .",NPN,english
Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

"Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition is a letter to be sent under John's John 's name ( if so , to whom will the letter be sent ) ?",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities .",NPN,english
"With these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations .",NPN,english
I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Finally , a question regarding timing .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( Shona took this to do after Brent's Brent 's return to Houston ) for comments to all business controllers .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"I don't do n't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"And not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards .",NPN,english
My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year .,NPN,english
There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english

"Despite the best efforts of IT , continuing problems with the AS400 application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values .",NPN,english

"We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l , as a result of data or system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe .",NPN,english

"If Sam's Sam 's description below of the GCP procedure is correct , it looks to me like something needs to be changed .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's counterparty 's name from Global Counterparty .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names .,NPN,english
"If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty , the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
That is the source of Tana's Tana 's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

Attached is PG&E's PG&E 's Gas Accord II ( GA II ) Settlement Proposal .,NPN,english
We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"As an overview , this proposal : * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007 . *",NPN,english
* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today . *,NPN,english
* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *,NPN,english
"* Offers a 7.5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *",NPN,english
"* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets , and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period ( 2003 - 2007 ) . *",NPN,english
"* Provides a high degree of rate stability , with a 3.5 % escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects .",NPN,english
The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events . *,NPN,english
"* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths , although somewhat less than the current differential . *",NPN,english
"* Proposes a two - stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003 , with end users receiving a first option on available capacity . *",NPN,english
* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments .,NPN,english
"PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism ( CPIM ) will be similar to today's today 's mechanism , but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1 - day in 10 - year cold weather event .",NPN,english
"This also will serve as a reminder that an all - Party meeting is scheduled at PG&E's PG&E 's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11 , to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions .",NPN,english
We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

"instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 % , I think we should acknowledge that a "" modest "" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim .",NPN,english
"In general , we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Otherwise , I think you have captured the points excellently .",NPN,english

"OBSERVATION -- The pressure to finger somebody for "" price gouging "" is increasing .",NPN,english

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form .,NPN,english
Attached please find a sample short form ( for the Con Ed market ) for your review .,NPN,english
Please note the following as you review :,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer ( and reflect same on our invoice ) and pass those amounts on to the customer's customer 's utility .,NPN,english
"2 . I did not include a "" Setoff "" provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh ( and we've we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past ) .,NPN,english
"Taking into consideration this class of customer , we decided to include certain items , including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law , rules or practices as a "" force majeure event "" in an effort to soften the approach ( see the GTCs ) .",NPN,english
"Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again , more in the interest of "" saving space "" than anything else ...",NPN,english

Probing the ' palace coup ',NPN,english
Electricity : A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president .,NPN,english
"September 26 , 2001",Resultative,english

The Orange County Register,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
SACRAMENTO,Resultative,english
A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's California 's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The investigative committee , headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : "" the palace coup . """,NPN,english
"Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's state 's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis , pushed the state into the power - buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers .",NPN,english
"The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50 - page request to remove the caps , records and interviews show .",NPN,english
""" I don't do n't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort , "" said Dunn .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The subpoenas will force those involved , including Winter , to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee , and to turn over e-mails , personal calendars and memos .",NPN,english
"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "" betrayed "" by the actions of Winter .",NPN,english
""" The governor believes it was the defining moment , when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis , "" Maviglio said .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Winter refused comment , referring all questions to the public relations office .",NPN,english
ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's Dunn 's committee will find no criminal conduct .,NPN,english
The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind : to keep the lights on .,NPN,english
"At the time , generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps .",NPN,english
""" It was an emergency , "" Fishman said .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
""" We had to take action . ''",NPN,english
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
The restrictions would drive prices as low as $ 65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $ 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier .,NPN,english
""" They ( electricity generators ) grinned and beared the $ 750 price cap , but this new plan by ISO was too much , "" said Dunn , whose committee has been investigating since March .",NPN,english
""" All hell broke loose . ''",NPN,english
"Records show that on Oct. 31 , power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , demanding that the new plan be killed .",NPN,english
"The letters , six in all , were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators .",NPN,english
""" If not removed immediately , the ( ISO ) price cap will sow confusion in the market , threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity , '' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps , Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "" fix "" prices , which would violate federal trade laws .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"In the Oct. 31 letters , electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't were n't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
The generators got their way .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"The next day , the federal commission killed the new pricing plan .",NPN,english
What was left in place was a $ 250 price cap established five months earlier .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap , saying they couldn't could n't make a profit even under these constraints .",NPN,english
"They began to withhold power from California , and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts , which were narrowly averted .",NPN,english
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Winter , who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO , submitted a 50 - page emergency request , asking federal officials to abolish the $ 250 price cap .",NPN,english
Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government .,NPN,english
"Neither the ISO board , which had established the price cap , nor the governor learned of Winter's Winter 's actions until the cap had been removed .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"In fact , the attorney who helped draft the emergency request , Charles Robinson , was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
He didn't did n't mention anything about it .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english

China's China 's insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan .,NPN,english
An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China's China 's soaring economic growth .,NPN,english
Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol,NPN,english
"The connection , however , lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan .",NPN,english
"The submarine incident was put down to a "" technical error "" by the Chinese government , which apologised to Japan .",NPN,english
"But even before the incident the People's People 's Daily , the government mouthpiece , had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "" only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy "" .",NPN,english
The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil - drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market .,NPN,english
"The West , however , has paid little attention to these developments .",NPN,english
"For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China's China 's relations with "" pariah states "" .",NPN,english

"A week before , China's China 's second biggest state oil firm had signed a $ 70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran , which already supplies 13 per cent of China's China 's needs .",NPN,english

"Its projected demand , boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation , has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year .",NPN,english
Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities .,NPN,english
"Since President Hu ordered state - owned oil firms to "" go abroad "" to ensure supply , they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea , just west of the line that Japan regards as its border .",NPN,english
"Japan protested , to no avail , that the project should be a joint one .",NPN,english
The two are also set to clash over Russia's Russia 's oil wealth .,NPN,english

""" It may be a difficult political issue but I don't do n't think the energy content is worthwhile . """,NPN,english
"Eurasia Group , a New York - based firm of political analysts , said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price .",NPN,english
""" If China's China 's economy falters , which , in my view , appears increasingly likely , then commodity prices will plummet , and with them , the value of the assets that produce them , "" Jason Kindopp , Eurasia's Eurasia 's lead China analyst , said .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President",NPN,english
My Fellow Americans :,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"As many of you may have heard , President Bush has nominated a long - time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court , to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Under our Constitution , this nomination cannot can not take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent , as described in our Constitution , Article II , Section 2 .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"A copy of the Constitution , with links back to the official source , is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt",NPN,english
Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position :,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
He has a very high intellect .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"He graduated very high in his class , from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale .",NPN,english
"He has a long and distinguished record , including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge , the next level below Supreme Court .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases , and he can recite details from memory .",NPN,english
"He demonstrates an excellent "" Judicial Temperament , "" being courteous , mild - mannered , respectful of all people ; careful in his work , meticulous in detail .",NPN,english
His co-workers love him .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
His fellow judges love him .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
His family loves him .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
President Bush loves him .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Yes , it is true that some people don't do n't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"But other people do like the way they think he will vote , and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon , on whether to approve him or not ; and at this moment ( evening of Jan. 27 , 2006 ) it looks like he has more than the fifty - one votes needed for approval .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote , because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court , to be judging the cases Bush is interested in .",NPN,english
So there is a lot of hurry - up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"There is an old saying that applies in this situation : "" Act in haste , repent at leisure . """,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly , then regret it for many years to come .",NPN,english
"That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito , in my opinion , because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice : He does not really agree with the system of "" Checks and Balances "" built into the Constitution , and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "" Unitary Executive Theory , "" which calls for vastly - increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
And because of this tragic flaw . . .,Resultative,english
""" He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances , Giving Far Too Much Power To The President . """,NPN,english
"In our Constitutional system , we have three branches of the Federal Government : the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial branches .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy , the other two can hold it down .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the "" Unitary Executive Theory "" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .",NPN,english
The Military is not part of the Executive Branch : it is a separate entity .,NPN,english
""" Commander In Chief "" doesn't does n't mean that he is the boss of the Military , merely mean that he is the Administrator , just as he is the Administrator of the Executive Branch , charged with "" executing faithfully "" all the laws passed by Congress and all the Decisions rendered by the Supreme Court .",NPN,english
"Under the Unitary Executive Theory , the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President , with no real authority over him .",NPN,english
"And the President becomes a Dictator , unrestrained by anything in the Constitution , backed up by the Armed Forces , which would be entirely under his personal control .",NPN,english
"And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship , no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II .",NPN,english
AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

Blue Planet : Who's Who 's afraid of Big Bad Wolf ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
By Dan Whipple,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL,Resultative,english
"Boulder , CO , Feb. 23 ( UPI ) --",Resultative,english
"Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood's Hood 's grandma and blew down the houses of two - thirds of the Three Little Pigs , the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation .",NPN,english
"In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan's Michigan 's Lake Superior .",NPN,english
The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943 .,NPN,english
"Western sheep and cattle ranchers , on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted , gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done .",NPN,english
"Their sheep could graze , their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard .",NPN,english
"After the major kill - offs , wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend .",NPN,english
"Like UFOs or Sasquatch , several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves , usually in Yellowstone .",NPN,english
"In the 1960s , a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves , then released them when their shooting was done .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"If so , this happy band has not been heard from since .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s , hoping to reestablish a breeding population .",NPN,english
"If true , the caper failed .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Over time , the wolf's wolf 's absence seemed to rehabilitate its image .",NPN,english
"Eventually , a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains .",NPN,english
"This trickle grew into a flood , resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still - continuing objections of ranchers .",NPN,english
"These wolf packs have flourished , and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies , where merely 10 years ago there were none .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator , an animal that affects the populations , behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range .",NPN,english
Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .,NPN,english
"OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "" the ecology of fear "" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf's wolf 's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs .",NPN,english
"They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .",NPN,english
"Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .",NPN,english
""" All you have to do is look at the photographs , "" Ed Bangs , wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , told UPI's UPI 's Blue Planet ,",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
""" You say , ' wow ! '",NPN,english
"An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow . """,NPN,english
This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone .,NPN,english
"More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver , for instance .",NPN,english
"Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park's park 's northern range before the wolves returned , now there are nine .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
""" It may be uninteresting to a lot of people , "" Beschta told Blue Planet .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
""" There's There 's a lot of impact on plants and they say , ' Who cares ? '",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
But we've we 've been looking at streamside communities .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"Since wolf recovery , streamside plants , willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers , a whole variety of avian species , berry - producing shrubs that bears can use .",NPN,english
It's It 's important with regard to the quality of streams .,NPN,english
The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability .,NPN,english
"Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems . """,NPN,english
"Yellowstone has a vast elk herd , one of the largest in the world .",NPN,english
"Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back , their behavior appears markedly different .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
""" I'm I 'm pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations , "" however , he cautioned .",NPN,english
""" Wolves are still pretty new .",NPN,english
They've They 've only been there for 10 years .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"In 10 more years we'll we 'll have a better idea . """,NPN,english
"Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal's animal 's status from endangered to threatened and , eventually , to remove it from the endangered species list altogether .",NPN,english
"Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies , as required by federal regulations .",NPN,english
"Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states , including Colorado , Utah and Oregon , among others .",NPN,english
"On Jan. 31 , Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them .",NPN,english
He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf's wolf 's status .,NPN,english
Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Regardless of the wolf's wolf 's legal status , its future expansion into new areas now seems likely .",NPN,english
Wolves can migrate considerable distances .,NPN,english
"A Yellowstone wolf was found dead , hit by a car , on a Colorado highway last year , several hundred miles from home .",NPN,english
"Meanwhile , his reputation seems to be improving , although Bangs noted a "" pretty interesting social dynamic . """,NPN,english
"There are only about 850 wolves in the West , but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Pound for pound , mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves .",NPN,english
"They even occasionally attack people , which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm .",NPN,english
"Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions , despite the risks .",NPN,english
It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
They seem to be just that : rumors .,NPN,english
"True , there are about 300,000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance , a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild , however , and they all almost certainly have died .",NPN,english
"He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves , scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants .",NPN,english

""" One of the major , most well - documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities , "" concluded a report titled "" Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States , "" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week .",NPN,english
Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

"Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly , which migrates between Mexico and southern California .",NPN,english

""" There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable . """,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"According to Parmesan's Parmesan 's earlier studies , one extinction event , for instance , was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely , relying on a warming temperature signal , then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat .",NPN,english
"Throughout the United States , she said , "" spring is about two weeks earlier .",NPN,english
Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier .,NPN,english

"Such consequences include shifting and , in some cases , contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems .",NPN,english
The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage .,NPN,english
"The Alaskan tundra , for instance , has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "" being a net source of CO2 ( releasing more carbon than is stored ) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2 .

"As with so much climate research , not everyone agrees with these dire predictions .",NPN,english
"A third report , "" The Impacts of Climate Change : An Appraisal for the Future , "" completed by the Britain - based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two , falls somewhat into that category .",NPN,english
"On the one hand , the IPN report agreed "" Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise .",NPN,english
"This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase . """,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"On the other hand , the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries .",NPN,english

"Important species that probably would decline include shrimp , capelin , Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish .",NPN,english
Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate .,NPN,english

Attack on Iran : A Looming Folly,NPN,english
By William Rivers Pitt,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
t r u t h o u t | Perspective,Resultative,english
Monday 09 January 2006,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran .,NPN,english
""" The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year , according to German media reports , reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media , "" reported UPI on December 30th .",NPN,english
""" The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week , "" continued UPI , "" quoted ' NATO intelligence sources ' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah - led regime into line , including military options .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"This ' all options are open ' line has been President George W Bush's Bush 's publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months . """,NPN,english
An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
1 . Blowback in Iraq,Resultative,english
"The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi'ite organizations , principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) .",NPN,english
Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi'ite leadership in Iran that go back decades .,NPN,english
"In essence , Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government .",NPN,english
"Should the United States undertake military action against Iran , the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"In the first eight days of January , eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq , compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday .",NPN,english
"Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias , believe the last elections were a sham , and hold little political power in the government .",NPN,english
"If the US attacks Iran , it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties , US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases , and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power .",NPN,english
"Iraq , already a seething cauldron , will sink further into chaos .",NPN,english
2 . Iran's Iran 's Armaments,Resultative,english
"Unlike Iraq , Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions , repeated attacks , and two American - led wars .",NPN,english
While Iran's Iran 's conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran - Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless .,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,english
"According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004 , Iran "" has some 540,000 men under arms and over 350,000 reserves .",NPN,english
"They include 120,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"Iran's Iran 's military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks , 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles , 3,200 artillery weapons , 306 combat aircraft , 60 attack helicopters , 3 submarines , 59 surface combatants , and 10 amphibious ships . """,NPN,english
""" Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability , "" continued the CSIS report .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
""" Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare , and poses the additional threat of proliferation .",NPN,english
There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long - range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons , and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown . """,NPN,english
"A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports , "" Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf , Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf .",NPN,english
The so called ' Tanker ' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region .,NPN,english
"Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping , and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective . """,NPN,english
""" More concerning , "" continued the MILNET brief , "" is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy .",NPN,english
"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect , anti-shipping cruise missiles : ' Iran has obtained new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China , midget submarines from North Korea , submarines from Russia , and modern mines . ' """,NPN,english
"It is Iran's Iran 's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf , especially for the US Navy .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Iran's Iran 's coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"The Gulf itself only has one exit , the Strait of Hormuz , which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline .",NPN,english
"In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf .",NPN,english
Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below .,NPN,english
"Of all the missiles in Iran's Iran 's armament , the most dangerous is the Russian - made SS-N-22 Sunburn .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"These missiles are , simply , the fastest anti-ship weapons on the planet .",NPN,english
The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude .,NPN,english
"Its maximum low - altitude speed is Mach 2.2 , some three times faster than the American - made Harpoon .",NPN,english
The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range .,NPN,english
"The missile's missile 's manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer , and five missiles could sink a 20,000 ton ship .",NPN,english
The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile .,NPN,english
"Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987 , killing 37 sailors .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
The Stark could not see them to stop them .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf , with some 7,000 souls aboard .",NPN,english
"Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force , which includes the USS Tarawa , the USS Austin , and the USS Pearl Harbor .",NPN,english
The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf .,NPN,english
"The Sunburn missile , with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection , would do terrible damage _ these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq .,NPN,english
"Currently , the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms , shoulder - fired grenades and roadside bombs .",NPN,english
"The vaunted American military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare .",NPN,english
"The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war , a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days .",NPN,english
"If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles , along with any or all of its nearly million - strong army , into the Iraq fray , the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
3 . The Syrian Connection,Resultative,english
"In February of 2005 , Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "" challenges and threats "" in the region .",NPN,english
"This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq , and a reaction to America's America 's condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus .",NPN,english
"An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact , and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces .",NPN,english
"Like Iran , Syria's Syria 's military is nothing to scoff at .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel .,NPN,english
Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel's Israel 's overwhelming capabilities .,NPN,english
"As of 2002 , Syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms , 4,700 tanks , and a massive artillery capability .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter / attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons , totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft .",NPN,english
"Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region , comprised primarily of SCUD - derived systems .",NPN,english
"Iran , North Korea and China have been willing providers of state - of - the - art technologies .",NPN,english
Compounding this is the well - based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf .,NPN,english
4 . China and the US Economy,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos , missiles in the Gulf , and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran , all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US / Iran engagement .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"China's China 's economy is exploding , hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry .",NPN,english
"In the last several months , China has inked deals with Iran for $ 70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas .",NPN,english
"China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years , will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran , and will receive 150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field .",NPN,english
"China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea , where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China .",NPN,english
Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Further , any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China's China 's liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz .",NPN,english
"Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran , the US would be faced with a significant threat .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"This threat exists not merely on a military level , though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan .",NPN,english
"More significantly , China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand .",NPN,english
"Paul Craig Roberts , writing for The American Conservative , said in July of 2005 that "" As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States , the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $ 1 trillion .",NPN,english
China's China 's accumulation of dollars is approximately $ 600 billion .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
South Korea holds about $ 200 billion .,NPN,english
These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States .,NPN,english
"By dumping some portion of their reserves , these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U.S. interest rates skyrocketing .",NPN,english
"Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action , but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan , for example - China holds the cards .",NPN,english
"China and Japan , and the world at large , have more dollar reserves than they require .",NPN,english
"They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose . """,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
""" The hardest blow on Americans , "" concluded Roberts , "" will fall when China does revalue its currency .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"When China's China 's currency ceases to be undervalued , American shoppers in Wal - Mart , where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China , will think they are in Neiman Marcus .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real incomes .,NPN,english
"If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market , American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression . """,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"In short , China has the American economy by the throat .",NPN,english
"Should they decide to squeeze , we will all feel it .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"China's China 's strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm ; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
5 . American Preparedness,Resultative,english
American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield .,NPN,english
The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception .,NPN,english
"The last three years of the Iraq occupation , however , have sapped this confidence .",NPN,english
"Worse , the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military , justifying the decrease in confidence .",NPN,english
"Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan , recruiting is at an all - time low .",NPN,english
Soldiers with vital training and know - how are refusing to re-enlist .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Across the board , the American military is stretched to the breaking point .",NPN,english
Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation .,NPN,english
"According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University , the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion , surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration .",NPN,english
"If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq , and comes to involve Syria , our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Add to this the economic threat posed by China , and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe .",NPN,english
"If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments , missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq , our troops there will be fish in a barrel .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Iran's Iran 's position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair .,NPN,english
"In the worst - case scenario , the newly - minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play , hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam .",NPN,english
Conclusion : Is Any of This Possible ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
The question must be put as directly as possible : what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq , Iran , Syria and China simultaneously .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons , but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat .",NPN,english
"Recently , Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation , and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor .",NPN,english
"Therefore , any attack upon Iran's Iran 's nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe .,NPN,english
"The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation , however , seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so - called "" War on Terror . """,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Unfortunately , all the dangers in the world are no match for the self - assurance of a bubble - encased zealot .",NPN,english
What manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
Look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
George W. Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front .,NPN,english
Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media .,Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"More significantly , recall Iraq .",NPN,english
"Karl Rove , Bush's Bush 's most senior advisor , notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "" run on the war . """,NPN,english
"The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms , but during the 2004 Presidential election .",NPN,english
"What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran , and from the diversion of attention to that attack ?",Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
The answer lies in one now - familiar name : Jack Abramoff .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard - fought GOP gains in Congress , and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away .",NPN,english
Is any of this a probability ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Logic says no , but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics .",NPN,english
All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth .,NPN,english
They did it once already in Iraq .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english

Unless the tank has a built in overflow box ( which I'm I 'm certain it doesn't does n't ) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M - 16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older ( dirtier ) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M - 14 .,NPN,english

What is Italian High Renaissance ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
"Have a look at this , it may help .",NPN,english
"1 ) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance , a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600 , marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe .",NPN,english
"The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century , in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt .",NPN,english
"Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .",Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,english
"The word renaissance ( Rinascimento in Italian ) means “ rebirth ” , and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .",NPN,english
"These changes , while significant , were concentrated in the elite , and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages .",NPN,english
"2 ) The expression High Renaissance , in art history , is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance .",NPN,english
"The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardos Leonardo s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .",NPN,english
"This term was first used in German ( Hochrenaissance ) in the early nineteenth century , and has its origins in the "" High Style "" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann .",NPN,english
"[ 1 ] Over the last twenty years , use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over-simplifying artistic developments , ignoring historical context , and focusing only on a few iconic works .",NPN,english

The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains .,NPN,english
Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike .,NPN,english

please specify which royal or carnival ship (:,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other .,NPN,english
Are there any major differences between them ?,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas .,NPN,english
"Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica , Grand Cayman , Cozumel , St. Thomas , the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten .",NPN,english
"The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay , Puerto Rico , and Grand Turk .",NPN,english
The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee ( the north coast of Haiti ) .,NPN,english
We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don't do n't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Shows Each night there are a variety of shows .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act .,NPN,english
"If you love seeing the shows , Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas .,NPN,english
We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas .,NPN,english
Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades .,NPN,english
We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty , but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have .,NPN,english
They both had pools for kids and adults .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
We liked the Liberty's Liberty 's pools better because one had a slide .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"If you have kids , this would be something that they would definitely enjoy .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it .,NPN,english

How could we make it settle in a new house .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,english
you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory .,NPN,english
"territory is very important to cats , and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators , or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so .",NPN,english

"close the door , and keep him in there for a week .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english

"he will explore the room , mark everything with his cheek , and try to make it feel like his territory .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

To answer your questions in order :,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"1 ) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"He could also have Parvovirus , a GI foreign body , or any number of things .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
Did your vet take radiographs ( x - rays ) ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
2 ) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn't did n't think it would be helpful .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"3 ) If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
It could be due to nausea or any number of things .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
He could become severly dehydrated ( especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea ) .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances , which can lead to heart and kidney problems .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"And being dehydrated , vomiting , and having diarrhea just doesn't does n't feel good .",NPN,english
4 ) Call your vet .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

"It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized , and put on IV fluids to help his hydration , administer the antibiotics IV , and to ensure that he starts to recover .",NPN,english

"For them , dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties , then pairing off .",NPN,english

She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

"You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment , but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you .",NPN,english

"Take the messages for what they are : she has no objection in you being pals at uni , but she does not want to take matters further .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english

"( the younger the eaiser to tame ) Look for clean smooth feathers , beak , and clean vent feathers ( the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy ) Look for a dark eye with no circles ( the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes ) .",NPN,english
Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird .,NPN,english
the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older .,NPN,english
( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers .,NPN,english
If you want a boy the cere ( the nostrils piece above the beak ) must be blue .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
The girl has either pink or brown .,NPN,english
I would recommend that you get two parakeets .,NPN,english
"But get either one male and one female , or two males .",NPN,english
Do not get two females .,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"They sometimes dont do nt get along ( you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though , two girls tend to fight a lot .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english

My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
These are the steps I used .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
Hopefully they will work for you .,Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"1 ) When you get the bird , place him or her or them in the cage .",NPN,english
Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
2 ) Then place you hand in the cage .,NPN,english
I took the cage and place it next to the couch .,NPN,english
"Then I sat on the couch , placed one hand in the cage , holding a millet spray .",NPN,english
"( this way the will associate your hand with food , and birds love food lol ) Then I turned on the tv and watch .",NPN,english
This way they will see that your hand is good and its it s not going to grab them or hurt them .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Do this for about one hour .,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
( you can take breaks if you have too ) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"3 ) After about day 2 , they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand .",NPN,english
"( do not take away the food dish from the birds , they will associate you as the person who takes away their food ) ....",NPN,english
"Then take your finger and place it under their belly , in front of their feet and say up .",NPN,english
Push you finger to their feet gently and say up .,NPN,english
( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont do nt jump back or screem they will get used to you ) They will have no choice but to go on your finger .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"When they see that you arnt ar nt harming them , the will go up on your finger when you say up .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
4 ) If they are not going up by now you just gotta got ta keep trying and keep trying .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Do not hit , yell , or harm them .",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
You have patience .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
Dont Do nt give up !,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder , when I say up it means to jump up on my finger , when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
and when I say go home it means to go in the cage .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Good luck !,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
They worked for me and I hope they worked for you !,Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english

We're We 're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we're we 're still young and before our lives start to get even crazier !,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be ?,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather , it is unpredictable .",NPN,english
One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February , but winter woollies in March and even during the summer .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
And then there’s there ’s the rain .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Ireland receives a lot of rain , with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year .",NPN,english
County Kerry is the worst affected .,NPN,english
"The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate .",NPN,english
"The Irish weather works on the ‘ four seasons in a day ’ principle , which basic­ally means that you can’t ca n’t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky .",NPN,english
"Some basic assumptions , however , can be made .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"In summer , from May to July , the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long : at the height of summer you won’t wo n’t need to turn on lights until after 10 pm .",NPN,english
"It is also peak tourist season , which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island , and prices are at their highest .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Not surprisingly , most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather .",NPN,english
"Spring ( February to April ) and Autumn ( August to October ) make good alternatives , although the country’s country ’s ever - growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid - and high - season tourism .",NPN,english
"Still , you have a better chance of some peace and quiet , and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July – again , it’s it ’s all part of the uncertainty principle .",NPN,english
Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick’s Patrick ’s Festival .,NPN,english
"Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing , winter ( December to February ) can be brutal , for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular .",Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,english
"Crowds are at their thinnest , but many of the country’s country ’s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don’t do n’t reopen until Easter , which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish : it’s it ’s cold , grey and dark by 5 pm , but there’s there ’s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you , clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..,NPN,english
"As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "" there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes """,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"Afraid I cannot can not be more helpful , it is really a case of pot luck , although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
The summer there is much more mild than most of the US ( are you coming from the US ? ) .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall .,NPN,english
It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet .,NPN,english
September for example .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime .,NPN,english
"To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns / cities , most rural places don't do n't have a bus or train service .",NPN,english
You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists .,NPN,english
By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way .,NPN,english
Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets / boots etc .,NPN,english
"We only had a few sunny days this summer , barely 24 C on a few occasions , more like 14 C most days .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter , windier & colder .",NPN,english
"We had frosts in October so I wouldn't would n't advise visiting late in the year to be honest , Spring time is your best bet .",NPN,english
You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english

If you have plants in your tank .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
your lineatus are already spawning .,NPN,english
"If conditions are favorable ( 78 - 82 F ) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are , they will spawn .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
( I've I 've even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer !,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Check out the second source .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs , more easily and the fish look better next to them .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"Use a well rinsed medicine vial , a cork , new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float them .",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks , picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated , seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"If you have the room to separate the male ( s ) & females ( s ) , & feed them well on live foods , ( assuming that you are doing weekly 50 % water changes ) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Just making up examples , but if a pair is constantly together , they may lay 10 - 15 eggs a day .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"With extra blackworms and maybe frozen ( defrosted , rinsed ) frozen foods earlier in the day , they may leave 30 - 40 eggs at a time .",NPN,english
"Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more .",NPN,english
Separating a pair some time before a show ( killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs ) will encourage them to court and show their best colors .,NPN,english
They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
The water changes help with that too .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
You also may need to treat the incubation water .,NPN,english
The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs .,NPN,english
Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .,NPN,english
"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe "" .",NPN,english
Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult's adult 's desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone .,NPN,english
If a pair isn't is n't leaving eggs ... check the following :,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
1 . Is a tank mate ( such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails ) rating the eggs ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
3 . Is there too much mineral in the water ?,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Aplo. lineatus are wide - spread over southern India .,NPN,english
That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries .,NPN,english
"Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS ( total Dissolved Solids ) test , that may give you a hint .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Winging it a little here , a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM ( parts per million ) or 5.8 to 10.6 DH should be fine for gardneri .",NPN,english
TDS meters ( the thrifty aquarist's aquarist 's hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department's department 's annual reports .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals ( calcium , magnesium and iron ) .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
A number of minerals are not of much consequence .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
However if there is a high level of sodium chloride ( common salt ) that can break down the chorion ( shell ) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo . ),Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs .,NPN,english
"THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "" breathe "" .",NPN,english
"If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial , that is fine .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"But get the eggs out , maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water .",Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container .,NPN,english
"After a number of people began complaining about "" mystery deaths "" among incubating eggs , some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7 - 8 days of incubation , one should do a 100 % water change - as the eggs develop , they do release waste material .",NPN,english
Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs .,NPN,english
"Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus , so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper .",NPN,english
Other will add a drop of Methylene blue .,NPN,english

I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free .,NPN,english
"He's He 's not lame , but he's he 's been having issues .",NPN,english
Here's Here 's what the owner has said :,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3 - 4 months ago .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"I chalked it up to possible nerve damage , because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels .,NPN,english
I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( I expected him to drop some ) .,NPN,english
He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day .,NPN,english
Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"He can eat all his feed and doesn't does n't drop any , but cannot can not eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it .",NPN,english
He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle .,Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead .,NPN,english
The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life .,NPN,english
I CANNOT CAN NOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"NO , I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam .",NPN,english
We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss , and some muscle atrophy .",NPN,english
He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws .,NPN,english
So I might get the horse and see what I can do .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him , have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test .",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well .,NPN,english
My other theory would be wobblers .,NPN,english
I'll I 'll be having my equine chiro / acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him ....,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
So any ideas ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Think I should do it ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
"Arby ,",Resultative,english
Horse is out of state and not local .,NPN,english
Owner is willing to meet me half way with him .,NPN,english
I will be calling my vet and chiro about him .,NPN,english
"Worse comes to worse , I'm I 'm out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament .",NPN,english
He's He 's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle .,NPN,english
This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn't would n't be able to afford and even if I spend 2 K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3 , that is not me to clarify .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
She is the one that can't ca n't afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn't does n't recover fully .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can't ca n't eat regular hay .,Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
I don't do n't think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I am not going to go pick up a horse I can't ca n't afford .,NPN,english
I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat .,NPN,english
The owner is the one who is unable .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I will also be having my other vet up who's who 's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers .,NPN,english
July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"He's He 's only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy , with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead ( which could or couldn't could n't be related ) .",NPN,english
The horse is not in pain .,NPN,english
He's He 's not starving .,NPN,english
He's He 's dropping we,NPN,english
The horse is not in pain .,NPN,english
He's He 's not starving .,NPN,english
"He's He 's dropping weight , but most of that came from being at the trainers trainer s and being ridden hard for 60 days .",NPN,english
He's He 's not putting it back on .,NPN,english
I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I know this is going to be expensive .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
I'm I 'm willing to give it a shot .,NPN,english
"Gallop , I've I 've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well .",NPN,english
"Looked at studies , treatment options and such .",NPN,english
I will have the EPM test done before treating .,NPN,english
The chiro / acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
If that is the case then acupuncture isn't is n't going to hurt him .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
It's It 's actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM,NPN,english
I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals ( and a bunch of Yahoos ) before you decide to take this horse on .,NPN,english
I do think some Y!A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can't ca n't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down .,NPN,english
Is that something you are up for ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
If so go for it and I'll I 'll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down , but some horses are worth the risk .",NPN,english
If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we've we 've had to deal with it .,NPN,english
Pretty much every large stable has here .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada .,Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
That horse returned to racing and we didn't did n't notice much difference .,NPN,english
"We've We 've had a few since then , but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida .",Existential-HavePred-ItExpl-ThereExpl,english
"I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers , but we haven't have n't had an EPM horse in at least 10 years .",Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM .,NPN,english
We've We 've always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1 / 2 mile .,NPN,english
The only difference we noticed is that the EPM horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
It might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns .,NPN,english
I don't do n't know .,NPN,english
MSU does a lot of EPM studies because of how common it is here .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
You may want to see if you can get in touch with their EPM group and get this guy in a study .,Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
I know they did lab work showing that Strongid C used daily could help prevent EPM .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"I believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now , but it may be some time before those results are released .",Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
Another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be West Nile ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
West Nile can cause EPM like symptoms and doesn't does n't always include a fever .,NPN,english
Let us know what you decide to do .,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,english
"You hate to see talent get wasted , but honestly I don't do n't think I could take in a horse right now these issues .",NPN,english
Personally I think you should just keep on walking by .,NPN,english
You should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not .,Interrogative-Polar-Indirect,english
"If you have a good repoire ( which I'm I 'm sure you do ) with them , they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...",Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
"Even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh , there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future .",Existential-CopPred-ThereExpl,english
"So all in all , put the money up front before taking on this horse .",NPN,english
A few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english
Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Or a difficult birth ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Was it always like this ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
Or has it occurred since birth .,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english
I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke ?,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,english

Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively ; and it's it 's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem .,Conditional-UnspecifiedEpistemic-NoInversion,english

But not at a risk to other people's people 's pets .,NPN,english
"You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home , to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times , getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later .",NPN,english

你 順便 再 問問 豪仔 晚上 會 否 回來 吃飯 。,Resultative,chinese

深夜 才 播 卡通片 ， 令 小朋友們 都 捱夜 追 看 。,Resultative,chinese
唉 ！,Resultative,chinese
差不多 半夜 一 時 才 去 睡 。,Resultative,chinese
我 和 哥哥 小時候 也 愛 晚上 偷偷 出 廳 看 金田一 。,Resultative,chinese

見 到 別人 有 十 個 一 元 左右 ， 就 排 在 他 後面 。,Resultative,chinese
等 他 扭 光 十 元 也 不 中 閃卡 時 ， 我們 便 行動 。,Resultative,chinese
扭 卡 一定 要 帶 電筒 。,Resultative,chinese

那時 我 在 去 了 哪裡 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
你 還 沒 出世 ！,Resultative,chinese
怎 可能 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 才 小 他 幾 歲 。,Resultative,chinese
我 忘 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 偏心 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 來 ， 我 來 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 先 坐 下 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 心虛 啊 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
你 趕快 收拾 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
剛剛 才 說 要 拿 去 哥哥 那邊 ！,Resultative,chinese
她 女朋友 也 在 。,Resultative,chinese
我 才 免得 做 電燈泡 。,Resultative,chinese
你 知道 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
陳奕迅 跟 楊千嬅 剛 出道 時 ， 他們 是 一 對 的 。,Resultative,chinese
我 又 不 認識 他們 。,Resultative,chinese
對 了 ， 那 時候 你們 一 個 喜歡 陳奕迅 ， 一 個 喜歡 黎明 。,Resultative,chinese
誰 喜歡 哪個 我 都 忘 了 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
哪 有 人 喜歡 黎明 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
一定 是 哥哥 胡說 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 從沒 喜歡 什麼 明星 ！,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 可以 …… 做 我 的 …… 筆友 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
你 也 知 我 不 愛 上課 ！,Resultative,chinese
什麼 眾數 、 平均數 、 中位數 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
怎麼 分辨 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 不 懂 。,Resultative,chinese
最 高 頻率 那 組 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
哦 。,Resultative,chinese
平均數 呢 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
你 就 刻薄 ！,Resultative,chinese
啊 ， 原來 這樣 ！,Resultative,chinese
差不多 了 。,Resultative,chinese
第七 題 我 完成 了 ， 直方圖 。,Resultative,chinese
那 是 直方圖 。,Resultative,chinese
這個 我 知道 。,Resultative,chinese
對 了 ， 陳奕迅 的 新 碟 你 聽 過 了 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
當然 有 楊千嬅 ！,Resultative,chinese
他們 這麼 好 朋友 。,Resultative,chinese
未 聽 過 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
你 等一等 。,Resultative,chinese
我 播 給 你 聽 。,Resultative,chinese
黎明 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
沒 品味 ！,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
關 你 什麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
喂 ， 你 幹麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 正在 聽 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
開 電視 幹 什麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
別 阻礙 我 ！,Resultative,chinese
閉嘴 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 要 聽 電台 ！,Resultative,chinese
知道 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
那 你 快 坐 下 然後 閉嘴 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 很 煩 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 回去 做 你 的 功課 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
去 做 功課 ， 別 吵 著 我 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 誰 打 電話 來 的 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
關 你 什麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
喂 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
聽 到 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
對 啊 ， 這 是 最 新 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
沒 聽 過 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 覺得 陳奕迅 同 楊千嬅 最後 會 一起 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
不 是 蠻 合襯 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
你 說 陳奕迅 有 什麼 不 好 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
在 未 有 MP3 的 年代 ， 電台 播 什麼 歌 ， 我們 就 流行 歌 。,Resultative,chinese
在 九零三 與 新城電台 間 轉 來 轉 去 。,Resultative,chinese
阿哥 愛 聽 陳奕迅 ， 我 就 一起 聽 陳奕迅 。,Resultative,chinese
要 聽 歌 還 可以 用 十 元 買 一 隻 雜錦 錄音帶 ， 或是 花 二十 元 買 張 盜版 。,Resultative,chinese
你 自稱 是 歌迷 的話 ， 當然 是 買 華星 正版 唱片 ！,Resultative,chinese
那 時候 唱片 店 比 現在 七十一 還 要 多 。,Resultative,chinese
唱片 也 跟 現在 一樣 ， 一 張 一百 元 左右 。,Resultative,chinese
而且 陳奕迅 每 兩 三 個 月 便 出 一 張 新 唱片 。,Resultative,chinese
但 在 小時候 反而 有 錢 能 把 想 要 的 唱片 都 全部 購入 。,Resultative,chinese
不 懂 哥哥 什麼 叫 好 品味 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
但 就 是 每 天 也 聽 個 不 停 。,Resultative,chinese
又 是 只有 腸粉 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 要 吃 蛋撻 ！,Resultative,chinese
趕快 吃 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
如果 阿爺 發現 我們 不 在 大家樂 ， 就 慘 了 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
那些 唱片 又 不 是 我 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
快 把 錢 還 給 我 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 沒 一起 聽 嗎 ？ 沒 一起 唱 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
兩 包 腸粉 就 六 元 ⋯⋯,Resultative,chinese
怕 了 你 ！,Resultative,chinese
給 你 兩 元 吧 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
不 行 ！,Resultative,chinese
這樣 不 公平 ！,Resultative,chinese
十 元 ！,Resultative,chinese
五 元 ！,Resultative,chinese
不 行 ！,Resultative,chinese
要不 ⋯⋯ 你 買 新 一 期 Yes! 送 我 。,Resultative,chinese
傻 的 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
這麼 貴 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 在 學校 問 朋友 借 來 看 好了 。,Resultative,chinese
不 行 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 要 跟 媽媽 說 ！,Resultative,chinese
要不 這樣 ， 我 給 你 兩 元 ， 再 給 你 扭 三 張 Yes!卡 。,Resultative,chinese
這樣 可以 了 吧 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
好 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
待會兒 就 去 ！,Resultative,chinese
快 吃 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
但是 那 天 ， 哥哥 買 回來 的 竟然 不 是 陳奕迅 ， 而 是 楊千嬅 的 唱片 。,Resultative,chinese
家 中 還 出現 了 一 本 Yes! 。,Resultative,chinese
我 還 以為 哥哥 對 我 這樣 好 。,Resultative,chinese
隔 天 我 拿 著 本 破破爛爛 的 Yes! ， 問 他 封面 去 了 哪裡 去 。,Resultative,chinese
那 時候 我 才 明白 他 的 好 品味 不 是 陳奕迅 。,Resultative,chinese
應該 也 不 是 楊千嬅 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不 懂 你們 說 的 什麼 品味 。,Resultative,chinese
這些 流行曲 我 不 懂 欣賞 。,Resultative,chinese
都 不 知 有 什麼 好 聽 。,Resultative,chinese
不 知道 呢 。,Resultative,chinese
哦 。,Resultative,chinese
要 用 三角形內角總和 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
哦 。,Resultative,chinese
你 完成 了 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
真 羨慕 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 還 有 很 多 未 做 好 。,Resultative,chinese
你 來 教 我 吧 。,Resultative,chinese
你 可以 閉嘴 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
我 正 錄 英文 功課 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 等等 我 。,Resultative,chinese
我 也 要 問 功課 ！,Resultative,chinese
不 是 只 有 你 有 功課 做 ！,Resultative,chinese
以大欺小！ 。,Resultative,chinese
你 先 做 其他 功課 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 只 差 這 一 份 ！,Resultative,chinese
八號 要 交 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 等等 。,Resultative,chinese
怕 了 你 ！,Resultative,chinese
等 一下 。,Resultative,chinese
喂 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
我 妹妹 有 功課 不 會 。,Resultative,chinese
我 想 先 教教 她 。,Resultative,chinese
對 ， 她 有點 煩人 。,Resultative,chinese
待會兒 我 再 打 給 你 ！,Resultative,chinese
那 題 我 明白 了 。,Resultative,chinese
好 的 ， 再見 ！,Resultative,chinese
喂 ！ 借 盒 錄音帶 給 我 。,Resultative,chinese
不 要 ！,Resultative,chinese
為什麼 要 借 給 你 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 有 朋友 八號 生日 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 想 錄 些 東西 給 她 。,Resultative,chinese
關 我 什麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
喂 ， 關係 到 將來 你 有 沒有 利是錢 收 。,Resultative,chinese
喂 ！,Resultative,chinese
嚇 死 人 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 在 幹麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 專心 刷牙 啦 ！,Resultative,chinese
滴 到 四周 也 有 ！,Resultative,chinese
刷 好 快 些 去 睡 ！,Resultative,chinese

又 怎麼 了 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
別 吵 ！,Resultative,chinese
小心 吵 醒 爺爺 ！,Resultative,chinese
那 你 要 幹麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
計數！ ！,Resultative,chinese
記 著 ， 每 一 面 三十 分鐘 。,Resultative,chinese
我 選 歌 ， 你 計數 。,Resultative,chinese
中間 不 要 有 空白 ， 明白 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
對 我 有 什麼 好處 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 不 幫 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
打 你 一 身 ！,Resultative,chinese
記 下 ， 第一 首 ， 《 抬起我的頭來 》 ， 三 分 二十一 秒 。,Resultative,chinese
等等 ！,Resultative,chinese
第二 首 。,Resultative,chinese
等等 ！,Resultative,chinese
《 黑夜不再來 》,Resultative,chinese
等一等 呀 ！,Resultative,chinese
四 分 五 秒 。,Resultative,chinese
等等 ！,Resultative,chinese
第一 首 有 多 長 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
三 分 二十一 呀 。,Resultative,chinese
什麼 來 的 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
《 夏天的故事 》 之後 ， 哥哥 沒 再 買 過 陳奕迅 以外 的 唱片 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 我 也 不 明白 ， 哥哥 為何 不 直接 送 楊千嬅 的 唱片 給 他 朋友 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 覺得 那 一 晚 ， 我們 幹 了 一 場 很 帥 很 浪漫 的 事情 。,Resultative,chinese
收拾 好 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 要 聽 《 森美小儀dotdotdot 》 ！,Resultative,chinese
快 轉 到 九零三 ！,Resultative,chinese
等等 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
快 些 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
這 首 你 剛剛 才 錄 了 。,Resultative,chinese

這 就 是 九零三 。,Resultative,chinese
你自己 看看 吧 。,Resultative,chinese
接收 不 到 ， 你 弄 壞 了 。,Resultative,chinese
你 快 弄 好 回來 呀 。,Resultative,chinese
到 那 邊 試試 。,Resultative,chinese
仍 接收 不 到 。,Resultative,chinese
舉 高 收音機 。,Resultative,chinese
你 試試 把 天線 伸 到 窗 邊 。,Resultative,chinese
還是 沒 反應 。,Resultative,chinese
你 走 到 另 一 邊 試試 。,Resultative,chinese
轉 個 圈 看看 。,Resultative,chinese
跳 兩 步 。,Resultative,chinese
再 舉 高 試試 收 不 收 到 。,Resultative,chinese
再 舉 高 。,Resultative,chinese
再 高 一些 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 要 我 試 多少 次 才 行 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
很 重 啊 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 最 後 一 個 踫 它 。,Resultative,chinese
是 你 弄 壞 的 。,Resultative,chinese
你 要 負責 弄 好 。,Resultative,chinese
關 我 什麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
這 句 有效 ！,Resultative,chinese
繼續 說 ！,Resultative,chinese

說 快 一點 ！,Resultative,chinese
關 我 什麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
再 快 ， 要 更 快 ！,Resultative,chinese
關 我 什麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
喂 ！,Resultative,chinese
有 什麼 好 笑 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
小聲 一點 ！,Resultative,chinese
吵 醒 人 啦 ！,Resultative,chinese
小聲 一點 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 的 拖鞋聲 很 吵 ！,Resultative,chinese
別 吵 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
難度 要 我 不 穿 拖鞋 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
什麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
難度 要 我 不 穿 拖鞋 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
你 再 大聲 說話 小心 爺爺 起床 打 你 ， 知道 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
不 知道 。,Resultative,chinese
你 想 我 代 爺爺 打 你 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
還 敢 吵 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
乖乖 坐 下 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
不 要 。,Resultative,chinese
臭小鬼 ！,Resultative,chinese
真的 要 我 出手 才 行 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
快 拿 起 收音機 再 跳 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 今天 扭 到 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 送 給 你 再 送 給 你 的 朋友 ！,Resultative,chinese
幫 我 跟 她 說 聲 「 生日快樂 」 ！,Resultative,chinese
不用 了 。,Resultative,chinese
喂 ， 我 特意 跟 朋友 交換 回來 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
已經 是 千禧年 了 ， 沒有 人 會 再 聽 錄音帶 ！,Resultative,chinese
傻瓜 ！,Resultative,chinese
就 是 這 一 盒 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
對 了 ， 對 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
《 抬起我的頭來 》,Resultative,chinese
《 今天等我來 》,Resultative,chinese
《 不再讓你孤單 》,Resultative,chinese
《 今日 》,Resultative,chinese
《 每一個明天 》,Resultative,chinese
《 夏天的故事 》,Resultative,chinese
《 伴遊 》,Resultative,chinese
《 與我常在 》,Resultative,chinese
《 有發生過 》,Resultative,chinese
什麼 ？ 童年 經典 ── 《 龍珠 》 主題曲 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
難怪 那時 他 追 不 到 那 女孩 ！,Resultative,chinese
那 部 機 還 在 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
有 了 。,Resultative,chinese
竟然 能 找 到 ！,Resultative,chinese
怎 會 是 這樣 的 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
他 總是 在 欺負 我 ！,Resultative,chinese
每 一 個 歌手 都 有 一 個 藝名 的 。,Resultative,chinese
唉呀 ！ 這 個 沒有 人 贊成 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
因為 我 這 年紀 的 人 ， 應該 在 家 帶 孫子 ， 煮飯 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 不 是 那 種 人 ， 我 就 是 愛 出去 玩 的 性格 。,Resultative,chinese
我 很 喜歡 唱歌 。,Resultative,chinese
起初 是 來 唱歌 的 ， 漸漸 就 變成 工作 。,Resultative,chinese
上 一 手 退休 便 讓 給 我 ， 我 就 接手 啦 。,Resultative,chinese
唱歌 就 是 可以 抒發 開心 與 不 快樂 的 。,Resultative,chinese
要 我 幫忙 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
弄 到 哪裏 去 了 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
可以 怎樣 稱呼 我 ？ 我 只 知道 整 條 街 都 稱 我 「 大家姐 」 ， 因為 我 最 大 ， 年紀 最 大 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 姓 湯 ， 但 整 條 街 沒有 人 知道 我 姓 湯 ， 沒有 人 知道 我 叫 什麼 名字 。,Resultative,chinese
幫 別人 打工 幾 年 了 。,Resultative,chinese
後來 老闆 解僱 我 ， 我 很 感謝 他 解僱 我 呢 ！,Resultative,chinese
否則 我 便 不 能 自己 開 這 個 檔口 。,Resultative,chinese
他 解僱 我 以後 ， 剛好 這邊 的 老闆 很 忙 ， 做 不 來 ， 打理 不 了 。,Resultative,chinese
我 看上 了 ， 就 跟 他 說 不如 把 桌子 椅子 讓 給 我 ， 才 做 了 一 年 半 呢 。,Resultative,chinese
我 告訴 你們 年輕 的 啊 ， 我 是 過來人 。,Resultative,chinese
總 要 幫 別人 打工 的 ， 打 過 工 有 經驗 了 ， 自己 就 能 做 好 。,Resultative,chinese
天生我材必有用 。,Resultative,chinese
多 讀書 就 自然 能 有用 ， 對 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
我 都 是 這樣 教 我 女兒 的 。,Resultative,chinese
我 只 有 一 個 女 ， 沒 兒子 。,Resultative,chinese
天生我材必有用 。,Resultative,chinese
不用 唱 得 很 好聽 、 很 動聽 。,Resultative,chinese
全 都 是 自發性 的 ， 可以 抒發 自己 。,Resultative,chinese
比如說 《 男兒當自強 》 ， 多 雄壯 ！,Resultative,chinese
即使 音調 不 對 ， 也 可以 發洩 一下 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 歌檔 就 是 這樣 形成 ， 讓 勞動者 、 勞動 階級 、 旅客 、 西人 ， 來 到 捧場 。,Resultative,chinese
以前 這 檔 是 彈琴 的 ， 我 卻 不 學 他們 ， 要 創新 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 要 弄 卡拉OK ， 琴師 也 不用 。,Resultative,chinese
像 電源 ， 我 不 用 別人 的 ， 自己 預備 發電機 。,Resultative,chinese
像 昨晚 因為 下 雨 ， 電工 不 供 電 他們 就 沒 電 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
自己 帶 發電機 ， 不 就 有 電 了 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
不過 我自己 一 個 女人 ， 體力 有限 ， 拉 不 動 ， 找 人 幫忙 。,Resultative,chinese
我 做 這 行業 ， 脾氣 都 變 好 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
以前 脾氣 火爆 都 要 變 得 溫柔 可愛 。,Resultative,chinese
我 對 別人 好 ， 別人 就 對 我 好 ！,Resultative,chinese
對 著 客人 要 嬉皮笑臉 ， 那 別人 才 會 幫 你 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
即使 很 臭 的 乞丐 、 醉酒 的 人 我 都 不 會 趕 他們 走 。,Resultative,chinese
有 人氣 就 是 有 財氣 ， 有 財氣 就 是 有 福氣 ， 有 了 福氣 就 有 運氣 ！,Resultative,chinese
家人 有 說 不要 開 歌檔 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
唉呀 ！ 這 個 沒有 人 贊成 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
因為 我 這 年紀 的 人 ， 應該 在 家 帶 孫子 、 煮飯 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 不 是 那 種 人 ， 我 就 是 愛 出去 玩 的 性格 ， 不 愛 做 家務 、 帶 小孩 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 沒有 人 贊成 ， 但 我 就 是 偏偏 不 聽 別人 的 話 。,Resultative,chinese
多數 唱 張學友 、 張國榮 、 Beyond 。,Resultative,chinese
有些 歌 他們 常常 唱 的 。,Resultative,chinese
《 讓一切隨風 》 幾乎 天天 都 有 人 唱 。,Resultative,chinese
《 分飛燕 》 呀 什麼 的 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
不過 我 這裡 不 唱 粵曲 。,Resultative,chinese
都 有 人 唱 新 歌 ！,Resultative,chinese
唱 那 個 …… 《 從不喜歡孤單一個 》 都 有 呢 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 以前 做 過 什麼 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
別 提 了 ！ 我 在 電視台 參加 比賽 ， 輸 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
八十年代 時 參賽 ， 入 不 到 圍 呢 ， 哈哈 ！,Resultative,chinese
從小 就 喜歡 唱歌 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
從 小 到 大 都 是 興趣 。,Resultative,chinese
但是 興趣 …… 發展 不 了 。,Resultative,chinese
二十 年 前 吧 ， 我 也 曾經 在 這裡 ， 只 有 歌廳 。,Resultative,chinese
然後 就 在 夜總會 唱 一 SET （ 四十五 分鐘 ） 。,Resultative,chinese
然後 我 又 轉行 做 經紀 了 。,Resultative,chinese
以前 …… 消費力 高 ， 現在 沒有 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
以前 歌廳 就 不同 了 。,Resultative,chinese
那邊 會 掛 著 一 個 箱 。,Resultative,chinese
客人 會 給 利是 ， 現在 都 沒有 了 。,Resultative,chinese
初初 都 會 覺得 好 難 接受 ， 但 無 辦法 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 我 初 來 到 香港 ， 要 生存 嘛 。,Resultative,chinese
突然 覺得 香港 …… 哇 ！ 租 又 貴 ， 這 又 貴 ， 那 又 貴 。,Resultative,chinese
別人 都 說 ： 「 你 一定 要 融入 香港 這 個 潮流 ， 否則 就 不 能 生存 。 」,Resultative,chinese
唯有 慢慢 適應 ……,Resultative,chinese
我 藝名 叫 金燕子 ， 是 我 在 廟街 的 藝名 。,Resultative,chinese
每 一 個 歌手 都 有 一 個 藝名 的 。,Resultative,chinese
我 在 廟街 這 個 歌唱 行業 已經 有 十七 年 。,Resultative,chinese
廟街 歌壇 就 是 靠 客人 打賞 給 歌手 。,Resultative,chinese
例如 我 想 點唱 什麼 歌 ， 我 付 多少 錢 ， 一百 塊 、 二百 塊 甚至 三百 塊 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,chinese
或者 想 和 某 個 客人 唱 這 首 歌 ， 我們 有 最 低 消費 一百 塊 。,Resultative,chinese
當時 我 為什麼 會 入 這 個 行業 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
因為 我 在 大陸 時 也 是 唱歌 、 做 歌手 。,Resultative,chinese
那 我 來 到 香港 都 希望 找 到 我 喜歡 的 行業 工作 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 來 到 香港 之後 就 找 朋友 、 看 報紙 。,Resultative,chinese
終於 有 個 朋友 介紹 我 在 酒樓 夜總會 唱歌 。,Resultative,chinese
在 那裡 認識 了 一些 唱歌 的 朋友 ， 就 帶 我 進 廟街 說 ： 「 廟街 都 有 歌 唱 ， 但 那裡 就 不 一樣 ， 是 靠 客人 打賞 。 」,Resultative,chinese
因為 我 來 了 香港 之後 ， 香港 的 朋友 都 跟 我 說 ： 「 你 千萬 要 明白 ， 你 在 香港 做 歌手 與 在 中國大陸 做 歌手 是 不同 的 。 」,Resultative,chinese
因為 在 香港 要 陪 客人 飲酒 、 聊天 ， 要 看 你 能 不 能 接受 到 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 我們 一向 都 是 自己 一 個 舞台 唱歌 ， 唱 完 歌 就 走 ， 不 需要 與 客人 打招呼 。,Resultative,chinese
那 是 我們 的 職業 （ 責 ） 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 是 拿 ……,Resultative,chinese
每 一 個 月 都 出糧 給 我們 。,Resultative,chinese
那 我們 就 走 去 別 家 場館 ， 或 「 跑場 」 。,Resultative,chinese
根本 不 懂得 跟 客人 相處 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 當時 的 內心 很 不 開心 ， 覺得 好像 好 委屈 自己 ⋯⋯,Resultative,chinese
接著 ， 漸漸 認識 了 客人 ， 那些 客人 都 當 我 是 朋友 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 一起 去 飲茶 、 一起 食飯 。,Resultative,chinese
甚至 我 請 他們 飲茶 、 食飯 。,Resultative,chinese
那 他們 回來 就 聽 我 唱歌 、 打賞 給 我 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 是 退 了 休 才 來 。,Resultative,chinese
太 悶 ， 在 家 就 阿彌陀佛 對 住 四 塊 牆 ！,Resultative,chinese
夜總會 是 聽 別人 唱 ， 來 這裡 是 實踐 自己 唱 。,Resultative,chinese
感覺 不 一樣 。,Resultative,chinese
是 歡樂 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 我們 退休 之 年 ， 和 子女 有 什麼 好 談 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 回去 自己 想想 ， 你 和 自己 的 老豆 老母 有 什麼 好 談 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
談 兩 句 就 吵架 了 ， 對 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
出面 這裡 認識 很多 朋友 ， 「 聽 下 歌 」 ， 「 開 下 心 」 。,Resultative,chinese
累 了 就 回 家 洗澡 「 找 周公 」 ， 幾 爽 。,Resultative,chinese
沒 苛求 。,Resultative,chinese
你 剛 說 夜總會 那 年代 的 廟街 跟 現在 有 分別 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
一樣 ， 一樣 …… 不 大 分別 ， 只 是 以前 沒有 這 三 檔 ， 現在 有 了 。,Resultative,chinese
一 、 二 、 三 ， 這 三 檔 ⋯⋯,Resultative,chinese
我 很 喜歡 唱歌 ， 起初 是 來 唱歌 的 ， 漸漸 就 變成 工作 。,Resultative,chinese
上 一 手 退休 便 讓 給 我 ， 我 就 接手 了 。,Resultative,chinese
我 叫 李紅 ， 人人 叫 我 紅姐 。,Resultative,chinese
這 條 街 早上 是 讓 人 行 的 。,Resultative,chinese
晚上 因為 旁邊 是 政府合署 已經 關門 ， 沒 什麼 人 使用 ， 很多 人 在 這裡 開 檔 。,Resultative,chinese
每 晚 由 七點半 ， 到 十一點半 。,Resultative,chinese
都 有 三十 年 了 。,Resultative,chinese
三十 年 來 …… 又 沒有 什麼 特別 經驗 ， 經驗 算 上 讚 比 罵 多 。,Resultative,chinese
有些 人 移民 去 外國 後 ， 回來 都 說 ： 「 紅姐 ， 你 千萬 不要 結束 這 個 檔 啊 ！ 這裡 是 廟街 的 文化 ！ 」,Resultative,chinese
他 不 想 廟街 失去 這樣 的 特色 檔口 ！,Resultative,chinese
老 一 輩 差不多 都 老死 了 。,Resultative,chinese
以前 不 是 這樣 的 ， 欄杆 那邊 圍 滿 人 。,Resultative,chinese
那 時候 七十 、 八十年代 ， 用 五百 元 鈔票 摺 成 紙飛機 飛 過來 的 ， 很 樂意 消費 ！,Resultative,chinese
不 像 現在 二十 塊 、 二十 塊 這樣 ， 真的 很 闊綽 。,Resultative,chinese
他們 都 是 水上人家 ， 做 躉船 、 運輸 等 。,Resultative,chinese
那 時候 黃 、 賭 、 毒 百花齊放 ， 最 能 賺錢 的 年代 。,Resultative,chinese
梅艷芳 剛剛 參加 歌唱 新秀 ， 還 未 有 知名度 。,Resultative,chinese
你 想像 一下 ！,Resultative,chinese
梅艷芳 在 這裡 唱 過 ， 羅文 、 尹光 又 在 這裡 唱 過 ， 多少 大 明星 在 這裡 唱 過 呀 ！,Resultative,chinese
現在 是 怎樣 了 ？ 結束 了 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
我 站 在 那邊 你們 還 唱 呢 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 站 著 我們 也 沒有 唱 啊 ！,Resultative,chinese
我們 快 要 走 了 ， 現在 正 下 雨 嘛 。,Resultative,chinese
人 不 留 人 ， 雨 留 人 。,Resultative,chinese
無 辦法 啊 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 有時候 會 有 人 投訴 ， 說 有 噪音 ， 所以 我們 十一點 就 要 收檔 。,Resultative,chinese
有時候 延遲 十五 分鐘 。,Resultative,chinese
家 裡 的 是 這 個 嗎 ……,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
喂 ， 阿Ｂ 呀 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 陪 我 去 北極 看 北極星 丫 ……,Resultative,chinese
北極光 丫 ……,Resultative,chinese
很 正點 ， 坐 郵輪 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 媽咪 沒 時間 呀 。,Resultative,chinese
問 了 你 媽 啦 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 為什麼 沒空 陪 我 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 放 暑假 的 ， 不用 上學 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 …… ！,Resultative,chinese
四萬多 塊 一 個 人 的 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不用 你 付 呀 。,Resultative,chinese
我 請 你 去 呀 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 陪 我 啦 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 ， 超 正點 的 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 坐 郵輪 ， 又 可以 呢 …… 上一上 岸 又 可以 去 shopping 。,Resultative,chinese
你 的 錢 我 全 程 都 付 了 。,Resultative,chinese
給 你 付 …… 船費 、 旅行費 、 酒店費 。,Resultative,chinese
四萬多 塊 一 個 人 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
只是 坐 郵輪 那 一 筆 已經 ……,Resultative,chinese
是 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
為什麼 你 沒空 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
是 的 …… ！,Resultative,chinese
你 為什麼 沒空 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
阿爸 、 阿媽 …… 沒空 啊 。,Resultative,chinese
他們 要 上班 。,Resultative,chinese
不然 我 不用 找 你 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 ， 你 陪 我 去 啦 ！,Resultative,chinese
不用 你 付 呀 …… 我 請 你 呀 ！,Resultative,chinese
我們 去 見識 一下 嘛 。,Resultative,chinese
沒 試 過 嘛 。,Resultative,chinese
坐 郵輪 去 看 北極星 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 放 暑假 的 那 時候 ， 不用 上學 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 ……,Resultative,chinese
ＯＫ 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
我 請 你 去 ！,Resultative,chinese
就 這樣 說 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 放 暑假 ， 不用 上學 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 …… ！,Resultative,chinese
沒 問題 ， 我 請 你 呀 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 去 啦 ！,Resultative,chinese
你 只是 陪 我 嘛 ， 沒 關係 喇 。,Resultative,chinese
今天 星期二 ！,Resultative,chinese
今天 是 星期三 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
今天 星期四 ！,Resultative,chinese
金剛郵輪 九 折 ！,Resultative,chinese
現在 出發 ！,Resultative,chinese
昨晚 呢 ， 我 下班 回 到 家 裡 。,Resultative,chinese
然之後 ， 我 兒子 問 我 ： 「 你 明天 去 旅行 嗎 ？ 」,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
我 說 ： 「 是 啊 ！ 」,Resultative,chinese
「 那 你 甚麼 時候 回來 呀 ？ 」,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 不 知道 啊 ！,Resultative,chinese
總之 我 明晚 不 回家 啦,Resultative,chinese
他 說 ： 「 那 你 甚麼 時候 會 回來 ？ 」,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 不 知道 啊 。,Resultative,chinese
我 明天 晚上 會 …… 不 回來 。,Resultative,chinese
接下來 甚麼 時候 回來 就 不 知道 了 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
總之 明晚 不 回家 了 。,Resultative,chinese
有 甚麼 事 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
為什麼 這樣 問 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
沒 甚麼 …… 我 掛念 你 而已 ……,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
可能 會 掛念 你 而已 。,Resultative,chinese
這樣子 ……,Resultative,chinese
他 整天 都 爆 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
血壓 高 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
哎也 ， 是 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
是 的 ， 有 量 血壓 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
唱 得 不錯 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 的 ， 不錯 ！,Resultative,chinese
是 騎馬舞 啊 ！,Resultative,chinese
…… 不 懂 啊 ……,Resultative,chinese
太 新 的 歌 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不 是 這 年代 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不 是 這 年代 ！,Resultative,chinese
誰 玩 樂器 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
卡啦ＯＫ 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
玩 得 開心 ……,Resultative,chinese
繼續 玩 吧 …… 繼續 玩 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
不如 先 看 一下 鄭多變 教 的 蟹蟹瘦身操,Resultative,chinese
你 要 繳付 四千二百六十 元 兩 毫 四 仙 。,Resultative,chinese
四四方方 那 個 ， 小 一點 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
三十 乘 三十 吧 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
是 的 ！,Resultative,chinese
那 個 呢 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
那 個 吧 ！,Resultative,chinese
說 了 你 要 量 好 尺寸 。,Resultative,chinese
這樣 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
是 的 ， 這 個 比較 好 。,Resultative,chinese
不要 太 靠近 電視 啊 ！,Resultative,chinese
小心 弄 破 了 ！,Resultative,chinese
Philip_ Wong …… 又 吃 這麼 多 。,Resultative,chinese
胖 死 你 呀 ， 吃 這麼 多 ！,Resultative,chinese
下 一 站 是 天富 。,Resultative,chinese
媽 、 爸 ： 八 日 七 夜 吉隆坡 ＋ 浮羅交怡 之 旅 來 到 第四 天 。,Resultative,chinese
住 在 這 家 酒店 ， 真的 很 正 ！,Resultative,chinese
一 行 出去 就 係 泳池 ， 再 行 出 Ｄ 就 係 沙灘 ！,Resultative,chinese
又 曬 黑 番黎 喇 ， 哈哈 ！,Resultative,chinese
有 無 想念 我 呢 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
很 快 回來 。,Resultative,chinese
秋 ， 一四年 五月 二十二日 。,Resultative,chinese
喂 ， 明信片 啊 ！,Resultative,chinese
都 已經 回來 了 ……,Resultative,chinese
剛才 秘書處 已 宣布 五 分鐘 後 復會 。,Resultative,chinese
現在 時間 已 過 了 五 分鐘 。,Resultative,chinese
我 想 跟 大家 說 ， 今天 的 會議 分為 兩 部分 。,Resultative,chinese
第一 部分 是 剛才 大家 已 完成 的 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
而 第二 部分 是 選舉 立法會 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
我 知道 有 同事 對 主席 候選人 的 國籍 問題 有 些 意見 。,Resultative,chinese
要求 候選人 就 某些 方面 作出 澄清 。,Resultative,chinese
由於 今天 的 會議 並 沒有 任何 程序 ， 容許 我們 在 會議廳 內 進行 澄清 、 提問 、 辯論 或 諮詢 等 ， 因此 我們 不 可以 在 會議廳 內 進行 這些 工作 。,Resultative,chinese
不過 ， 為 讓 一些 關注 此 事 的 議員 能 獲 澄清 ， 我 建議 梁君彥 議員 稍後 到 會議廳 外 ， 向 新聞 傳媒 交代 他 的 國籍 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
而 關注 此 事 的 議員 亦 可 出去 聆聽 他 的 闡述 ， 以及 可以 向 他 提問 。,Resultative,chinese
在 會議廳 內 ， 根據 《 議事 規則 》 ， 我 不 能 容許 大家 提問 或 作出 任何 討論 。,Resultative,chinese
我 現在 請 關注 此 事 的 議員 到 會議廳 外 ， 聽取 梁君彥 議員 的 交代 。,Resultative,chinese
我 預期 會議 將 在 下午 二 時 三十 分 正式 恢復 。,Resultative,chinese
我 的 發言 到此 結束 。,Resultative,chinese
現在 暫停 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
現在 是 二 時 三十五 分 ， 較 我 原先 宣佈 二 時 三十 分 恢復 會議 的 時間 ， 遲 了 五 分鐘 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不 想 再 延遲 。,Resultative,chinese
現在 宣佈 正式 復會 。,Resultative,chinese
會議 現 已 恢復 ， 我 希望 所有 同事 返回 自己 的 座位 。,Resultative,chinese
讓 我們 今天 可以 有 秩序 地 進行 選舉 主席 的 程式 。,Resultative,chinese
我 現在 再 請 所有 同事 返回 自己 的 座位 。,Resultative,chinese
有 議員 想 提出 規程 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
但 請 其他 同事 先行 返回 座位 ， 讓 秘書 幫 我 做 一些 文書 工作 。,Resultative,chinese
否則 ， 沒有 秘書 幫忙 ， 處理 上 會 比較 困難 。,Resultative,chinese
我 希望 其他 議員 先 返回 座位 ， 讓 我們 可以 進行 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 大家 有 任何 規程 問題 ， 可以 提出 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
我 會 給 大家 時間 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 我 想 問 秘書處 有 否 處理 梁君彥 議員 的 國籍 問題 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
他 剛才 ……,Resultative,chinese
剛才 我 說 過 ， 有關 梁君彥 議員 的 國籍 問題 不 是 今天 會議 的 討論 範疇 。,Resultative,chinese
好 的 。,Resultative,chinese
請 先 讓 我 說 ， 可以 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
我 剛才 已經 說 過 ， 為了 讓 大家 進一步 瞭解 有關 梁君彥 議員 的 國籍 問題 ， 或 要求 他 澄清 ， 我 已 作出 - 特別 安排 時間 ， 讓 梁 議員 在 會議廳 外 向 傳媒 作出 交代 和 澄清 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 各位 剛才 有 出席 ， 便 應該 知道 情況 如何 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
不過 ， 無論 當事人 如何 澄清 及 解釋 ， 在 這個 會議 上 ， 我 不 能 保證 令 大家 滿意 。,Resultative,chinese
作為 會議 主持人 ， 我 祇 能 根據 會議 規則 進行 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 議員 想 確保 他 的 問題 得到 滿意 的 答覆 ， 可以 在 其他 場合 提出 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
今天 的 會議 中 則 沒有 辦法 處理 這個 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
我 現在 想 問一問 ， 剛才 有 哪些 議員 曾 舉手 想 提出 規程 問題 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
我 看 不 到 。,Resultative,chinese
請 秘書 幫忙 把 曾 舉手 表示 想 提出 規程 問題 的 議員 名單 交 給 我 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 我 看 不 到 。,Resultative,chinese
今天 我 不 想 跟 大家 爭論 其他 問題 ， 因為 我 沒有 權力 這樣 做 。,Resultative,chinese
我 祇是 執行 會議 規則 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 我 也 不 是 很 想 主持 這 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
不過 ， 根據 《 議事 規則 》 附表 一 第六 及 七 段 的 規定 ， 由 擔任 議員 時間 最 長 的 我 來 主持 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
根據 會議 規則 ， 我 現在 祇 能 主持 投票 的 過程 。,Resultative,chinese
其他 事情 我 無法 處理 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 我 處理 的話 ， 便 違反 會議 規則 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
是 不 合法 的 。,Resultative,chinese
大家 如果 要 我 表明 這 個 會議 究竟 是 否 合法 ， 我 祇 能夠 說 ， 根據 會議 規則 ， 這 個 會議 是 合法 的 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
議員 如果 想 提出 規程 問題 ， 我 再 請 大家 先 返回 自己 的 座位 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
我 會 邀請 大家 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 不 離開 又 怎樣 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
如果 議員 真的 不 返回 座位 ， 也 不 要緊 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
但 請 不要 作出 騷擾 ， 以便 會議 可 繼續 進行 。,Resultative,chinese
根據 秘書 給 我 的 名單 ， 第一 位 提出 規程 問題 的 議員 是 毛孟靜 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
根據 《 議事 規則 》 ， 今天 的 規程 祇 能夠 涉及 選舉 過程 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 有 其他 問題 ， 請 議員 在 其他 場合 提出 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
現在 請 毛孟靜 議員 提問 。,Resultative,chinese
感謝 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不 是 故意 要 為難 你 或 甚麼 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
還 要 感謝 你 試圖 安排 我們 到 會議廳 外 聆聽 梁君彥 議員 的 解釋 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 已 聽 罷 他 的 解釋 。,Resultative,chinese
他 說 第一 封 信 是 關乎 其 國籍 或 外國 居留權 的 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
信 中 表示 已 enclosed （ 附上 ） 「 放棄 國籍 」 的 聲明 ，,Resultative,chinese
但 相關 的 copy 卻 並不 存在 。,Resultative,chinese
原來 那 是 一 封 電郵 。,Resultative,chinese
第二 封 信 才 是 正本 。,Resultative,chinese
但 他 暫時 仍 未 收 到 。,Resultative,chinese
我 想 就 此 提出 規程 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 《 基本法 》 已 訂明 ， 立法會 主席 必須 在 外國 無 居留權 。,Resultative,chinese
而 即使 兩 封 信 都 是 由 政府 發出 ， 但 卻 不 一定 是 法律 文件 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 最 主要 想 看 的 是 那 份 「 放棄 國籍 」 聲明 （ Declaration_of_Renunciation_of_British_Citizenship ） 。,Resultative,chinese
而 我 本人 也 有 一 份 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 是 否 應 待 他 收 到 有關 文件 。,Resultative,chinese
所有 事情 皆 被 正式 確認 後 ， 才 展開 選舉 程序 呢 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
好 的 ， 謝謝 你 ， 毛孟靜 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
我 剛才 說 過 ， 你 的 提問 祇 能夠 涉及 選舉 過程 或 與 選舉 有關 的 事情 。,Resultative,chinese
但 你 卻 要求 澄清 梁君彥 議員 的 國籍 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
我 剛才 已 作出 特別 安排 ， 讓 梁君彥 議員 向 大家 和 社會 大眾 作出 澄清 及 交代 。,Resultative,chinese
至於 他 的 答覆 能 否 回應 你 剛才 的 提問 ， 我 並不 能夠 提出 任何 意見 。,Resultative,chinese
不過 ， 我 想 對 大家 說 ， 鑒於 梁君彥 議員 已經 一而再、再而三 地 提供 資料 ， 並 在 公開 場合 作出 澄清 ， 議員 大 可 自行 決定 稍後 會 否 投票 支持 他 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 大家 認為 梁君彥 議員 的 答覆 未 能 回應 大家 的 提問 ， 大家 可以 決定 尋求 ……,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
那麼 梁天琦 也 不 應該 被 disqualified ， 對 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
我 也 不 知道 梁君彥 議員 究竟 是 否 真的 有 合法 權利 參選 ， 但 梁耀忠 議員 卻 要求 我們 自行 考慮 是 否 投票 給 他 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
你 是 否 也 可 要求 選民 自行 決定 是 否 投票 給 梁天琦 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
由於 立法會 主席 的 選舉 須 按照 《 議事 規則 》 附表 一 所 訂 的 程序 進行 。,Resultative,chinese
而 有關 的 條文 是 容許 議員 在 選舉 主席 的 會議 上 ， 就 候選人 的 事宜 進行 討論 的 。,Resultative,chinese
事實上 ， 有關 的 討論 亦 已 在 昨天 特別 安排 的 論壇 上 ……,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 我 不 是 要求 討論 。,Resultative,chinese
我 要求 的 是 法律 上 的 澄清 。,Resultative,chinese
他 一定 要 提供 一 份 放棄 英國 國籍 聲明 的 正式 文件 。,Resultative,chinese
而 最 好 當然 是 正本 。,Resultative,chinese
但 如果 暫時 沒有 正本 ， 向 我們 提供 一 份 copy 也 可以 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
不過 ， 現時 已經 說 得 很 清楚 。,Resultative,chinese
便 是 按照 我 的 理解 ， 他 仍未 收到 相關 文件 。,Resultative,chinese
試問 我們 怎 可以 在 這裡 進行 選舉 的 程序 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
據 我 瞭解 ， 《 基本法 》 訂明 立法會 主席 不 能夠 擁有 任何 其他 國家 的 居留權 。,Resultative,chinese
這 方面 已 清楚 訂明 ， 但 並 沒有 提及 候選人 。,Resultative,chinese
我 今天 不 是 要 與 大家 辯論 這個 問題 ， 但 如果 大家 想 澄清 的話 ， 便 應該 透過 其他 途徑 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
因為 我 既 非 具有 法律 背景 的 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
而 我 這 個 主席 的 身份 ， 也 不 能夠 作 任何 回答 。,Resultative,chinese
我 祇 能夠 ⋯⋯,Resultative,chinese
不好意思 ， 我 不 是 特別 要 為難 你 ， 亦 覺得 這樣 插言 不 禮貌 。,Resultative,chinese
不 要緊 。,Resultative,chinese
…… 但 按照 你 剛才 的 說法 ， 作為 立法會 主席 便 不 能夠 擁有 外國 居留權 。,Resultative,chinese
但是 ， 如果 要 進行 選舉 的話 ， 有 人 將 於 稍後 半 小時 ， 或 十 分鐘 後 便會 當選 主席 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
但 他 卻 未 能 在 今天 內 向 我們 提供 剛才 所 說 的 「 放棄 國籍 」 正式 聲明 。,Resultative,chinese
你 說 得 對 ……,Resultative,chinese
多謝 。,Resultative,chinese
…… 就 是 一旦 他 當選 ， 發覺 條件 不 符合 規定 ， 他 便 不 應該 成為 主席 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
這 是 正確 的 。,Resultative,chinese
不過 ， 問題 是 我 不 能夠 建議 他 接着 該 怎樣 做 ， 因為 我 沒有 這 個 身份 。,Resultative,chinese
我 祇 能夠 主持 ……,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 那麼 你 坐 在 這裡 做 甚麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
…… 你 說 得 對 。,Resultative,chinese
我 也 想 澄清 我 坐 在 這裡 做 甚麼 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Indirect,chinese
根據 《 議事 規則 》 ， 我 祇是 做 兩 件 事 。,Resultative,chinese
第一 ， 主持 主席 選舉 的 投票 。,Resultative,chinese
第二 ， 宣布 哪 位 候選人 當選 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 祇是 做 這 兩 件 事 。,Resultative,chinese
而 不 應該 做 其他 事 。,Resultative,chinese
最後 ， 一 個 規程 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
為了 抗爭 ， 為 表示 我 不 同意 現時 的 程序 ， 我 現在 也 走 出來 ， 站 在 你 後面 不 會 離開 。,Resultative,chinese
即使 你 呼籲 我 離開 ， 我 亦 不 會 離開 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
大家 是 否 要 一直 這樣 繼續 下去 呢 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
如果 你 不 影響 大家 的 投票 程序 ， 我 是 不 會 阻止 你 的 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
不過 ， 在 投票 前 ， 你 首先 需要 確定 我 、 梁頌恒 和 姚松炎 三 位 議員 的 投票權 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 ， 我 也 無 權 確定 你們 是 否 有 權 投票 。,Resultative,chinese
我 祇 能夠 接受 秘書 給 我 的 名單 ， 包括 候選人 和 有 資格 投票 的 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 ， 你 應該 向 秘書處 提出 ， 而 不 是 向 我 提出 ， 因為 我 無 權 代表 秘書處 說話 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 你 要 提出 ， 可以 向 秘書處 提出 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
第二 位 想 提出 規程 問題 的 議員 是 許智峯 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 我 想 你 清醒 地 想想 ， 我們 今天 是 否 ……,Resultative,chinese
我 清醒 與 否 不 是 由 你 判斷 的 。,Resultative,chinese
…… 我們 是 否 應該 繼續 進行 會議 並 選舉 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
毛孟靜 議員 和 多 位 非 建制 派 議員 剛才 說 過 ， 我們 不 信納 梁君彥 議員 已經 完全 放棄 英籍 或 放棄 英國 的 居留權 。,Resultative,chinese
在 這 種 情況 下 ， 要 我們 選舉 主席 並 不 公道 。,Resultative,chinese
這 是 第一 點 。,Resultative,chinese
第二 ， 站 在 你 身後 的 數 位 議員 ， 剛才 在 宣誓 時 遇到 一些 障礙 。,Resultative,chinese
由於 負責 監誓 的 秘書長 沒有 處理 他們 的 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
並 表示 他們 在 稍後 舉行 的 主席 選舉 中 不 可以 投票 。,Resultative,chinese
但是 ， 多 位 議員 認為 ， 他們 所 採用 的 宣誓 方式 ， 歷 屆 立法會 議員 也 曾 採用 類似 方式 ， 卻 沒有 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
這 證明 宣誓 過程 出現 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
令 數 位 議員 稍後 無法 進行 投票 ， 這 個 選舉 便 不 會 是 公平 及 符合 程序 公義 的 選舉 。,Resultative,chinese
我 想 請 你 決定 ， 面對 那麼 多 程序 公義 問題 ， 應 否 繼續 進行 會議 ， 選 出 一 位 沒有 任何 代表性 的 立法會 主席 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
主席 ， 你 擔任 「 代理 主席 」 亦 不 容易 。,Resultative,chinese
但是 ， 我 支持 你 執行 《 議事 規則 》 ， 包括 維持 議會 的 秩序 ， 確保 我們 選舉 主席 的 程序 能夠 順利 完成 。,Resultative,chinese
因為 這 是 憲制 工作 ， 亦 是 全 港 市民 正在 看 着 我們 做 的 事情 。,Resultative,chinese
此外 ， 我 想 請 你 也 瞭解 一下 《 議事 規則 》 。,Resultative,chinese
有 議員 沒有 合理 理由 而 在 你 身後 及 旁邊 站 着 。,Resultative,chinese
我 恐怕 這些 議員 已 涉嫌 違反 《 議事 規則 》 。,Resultative,chinese
希望 你 考慮 請 這些 議員 返回 座位 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 他們 經過 多次 勸諭 仍 不 返回 座位 ， 我 認為 你 應 執行 《 議事 規則 》 ， 以 維持 議會 的 秩序 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
這 是 第一 點 。,Resultative,chinese
第二 點 是 關於 議員 的 投票權 。,Resultative,chinese
我 同意 你 的 判斷 ， 便 是 秘書長 已 按照 法例 依法 為 我們 監誓 。,Resultative,chinese
我 亦 認為 有 數 位 議員 沒有 依照 誓詞 的 內容 完成 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
因此 ， 在 選舉 主席 的 過程 中 不 能 參與 表決 。,Resultative,chinese
這 情況 我 相信 所有 議員 都 明白 。,Resultative,chinese
由於 未 能 完成 宣誓 ， 因此 不 能 參與 選舉 。,Resultative,chinese
而 秘書長 亦 對 所有 他 懷疑 未 能 完成 宣誓 議員 給予 多 一 次 宣誓 的 機會 。,Resultative,chinese
我 認為 這 做法 已經 兼顧 到 人情 上 的 考慮 。,Resultative,chinese
第三 點 ， 至於 大家 質疑 梁君彥 議員 的 國籍 問題 ， 我 早 已 很 關心 此 事 ， 並 多 次 請 梁 議員 澄清 ， 要求 他 確認 。,Resultative,chinese
而 他 已 多次 確定 地 表示 事情 已經 處理 好 。,Resultative,chinese
及後 ， 亦 已 提供 英國 領事館 發出 的 兩 封 信 ， 供 大家 參閱 。,Resultative,chinese
當然 ， 議員 可以 要求 梁 議員 提供 一 份 證書 。,Resultative,chinese
這 點 我 是 理解 的 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 看 過 那 兩 封 信 後 ， 最低限度 認為 到 此刻 ， 沒有 其他 新 證據 指 梁 議員 的 英籍 問題 並 未 處理 。,Resultative,chinese
既然 已 定 了 今 天 選舉 主席 ， 我 認為 我們 應 按照 所 訂定 的 時間 安排 順利 完成 選舉 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
正如 其他 選舉 一樣 ， 有 人 可能 會 質疑 不同 候選人 的 某些 聲明 有誤 。,Resultative,chinese
大家 日後 可以 透過 不同 方式 跟進 ， 包括 司法 覆核 或 其他 法律 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
作為 議員 我們 都 很 理解 。,Resultative,chinese
我 希望 梁耀忠 議員 可以 公平 、 公正 地 主持 會議 ， 確保 我們 能夠 順利 選 出 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 我 留意 到 有些 同事 就 兩 位 候選人 的 其中 一 人 的 資格 提 出 了 意見 或 質疑 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 相信 在 這 個 會議廳 內 ， 雖然 不同 政治 立場 的 議員 對 此 事 抱持 不同 的 態度 ， 但 亦 不 能 因此 而 阻礙 今 天 既定 的 議程 。,Resultative,chinese
由 我們 完成 宣誓 至今 ， 我 相信 已 浪費 了 兩 小時 。,Resultative,chinese
而 閣下 的 工作 亦 祇是 主持 今 天 這 項 主席 選舉 ， 所以 我 希望 你 不要 再 浪費 時間 ， 直接 進入 立法會 主席 選舉 的 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
謝謝 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 毛孟靜 議員 剛才 提 到 一 個 觀點 ， 就 是 按照 最 嚴謹 、 最 謹慎 、 合理 的 做法 。,Resultative,chinese
在 我們 看 到 正式 文件 前 ， 實 難以 單憑 一 封 電郵 或 相關 文件 的 副本 予以 確認 ， 即使 我們 相信 他 。,Resultative,chinese
我 認為 今 次 選舉 主席 ， 後果 十分 重大 ， 足以 帶來 憲制 危機 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 是 否 必須 如此 草率 、 倉促 地 處理 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
另 一 點 ， 剛才 也 有 同事 提 到 ， 就 《 英國 國籍法 》 所 訂 有關 取消 國籍 和 居留權 的 問題 上 ， 我 認為 當中 仍 有 爭議 。,Resultative,chinese
而 我們 似乎 未 有 充分 諮詢 法律 意見 。,Resultative,chinese
在 此 情況 下 ， 就 《 基本法 》 第七十一 條 所 指 的 外國 居留權 問題 ， 我 認為 在 未 澄清 之前 ， 是 否 必須 在 這 一 刻 選舉 立法會 主席 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
剛才 提到 規程 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
你 說 你 的 責任 是 主持 會議 ， 以及 在 得 出 結果 後 ， 作 出 宣佈 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 有 一 件 事情 是 否 也 屬於 你 的 權力 範圍 ， 就 是 中止 整個 會議 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
面對 這些 法律 觀點 或 風險 ， 你 認為 今天 是 否 不 適宜 就 選舉 立法會 主席 作 出 決定 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
多謝 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
我 是 第一 次 參與 立法會 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
正如 李慧琼 議員 所 言 ， 很多 香港 人 正在 觀看 和 關注 這 次 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
正 因 如此 ， 我們 對 自己 應 有 更 高 的 要求 。,Resultative,chinese
剛才 我 留意 到 最大 的 問題 是 甚麼 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 仍 是 一 名 大學生 。,Resultative,chinese
但 這 次 選舉 的 嚴謹 程度 比 大學 學生會 選舉 更 不如 。,Resultative,chinese
怎 可能 在 尚 未 確定 候選人 的 國籍 便 開展 整個 程式 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
他 現在 祇 是 口頭 表示 ……,Resultative,chinese
雖然 有 人 指 那些 信件 可 證實 其 事 ， 但 都 不過 是 口頭上 的 確認 。,Resultative,chinese
倘若 秘書處 和 主席 對 整個 選舉 負責 ， 或 覺得 整個 立法會 要 取信於民 ， 重新 取得 市民 的 信任 ， 便 更 要 將 每 個 程式 做 得 更 嚴謹 ， 而 非 「 按 章 工作 」 ， 即 秘書處 說 不 需要 查 便 不 查 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
要求 提供 一 份 書面 和 具有 法律 效力 的 文件 ， 本應 很 簡單 。,Resultative,chinese
即使 我 參加 學生會 選舉 ， 亦 需 提供 學生證 ， 證明 我 是 大學 的 學生 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 如果 連 如此 簡單 的 程序 也 不 能 完成 ， 整個 立法會 不 可能 取信於人 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
這 是 第一 個 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
第二 個 問題 ， 我們 現在 尚 未 弄 清楚 多少 議員 能夠 投票 。,Resultative,chinese
《 議事 規則 》 最 基本 的 精神 是 確保 每 位 議員 有 充足 機會 完成 宣誓 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
而 秘書長 不 能 基於 完全 沒有 法律 理據 的 無理 質疑 ， 憑 其 個人 判斷 向 其他 議員 表示 他 沒有 能力 主持 監誓 。,Resultative,chinese
我 認為 這 是 完全 違反 了 《 議事 規則 》 應 有 的 精神 。,Resultative,chinese
即 讓 所有 議員 能夠 成功 完成 宣誓 程式 ， 然後 才 進行 立法會 主席 選舉 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 ， 秘書長 陳維安 剛才 的 決定 或 判斷 完全 是 arbitrary_use_of_power ， 是 完全 沒有 任何 基礎 的 判斷 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 大家 翻看 剛才 錄影 片段 ， 其實 三 位 議員 已 完整 讀 完 誓詞 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
而 《 議事 規則 》 祇 規定 議員 要 完整 讀 出 誓詞 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 秘書長 不 能 以 語氣 或 其他 條件 為 標準 ， 判斷 他 無權 監誓 。,Resultative,chinese
我 希望 主席 明白 大家 面前 有 兩 大 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 我們 不 先 處理 這些 問題 ， 然後 才 進行 主席 選舉 ， 立法會 便 難以 取信於人 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
我 相信 很多 議員 ， 包括 眾多 有 廣大 民意 基礎 支持 的 直選 議員 ， 都 不 能 信納 這 次 選舉 結果 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 今天 我們 向 香港 人 展示 一 個 粗疏 得 不 能 再 粗疏 的 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
梁君彥 議員 連 正本 都 拿 不 出來 證明 自己 的 國籍 。,Resultative,chinese
祇 提供 一 份 副本 不 像 副本 的 文件 。,Resultative,chinese
最 糟糕 的 是 ， 他 連 居留權 都 未 能 釐清 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 我們 今 天 在 一 種 如此 粗疏 的 情況 下 進入 選舉 立法會 的 程序 ， 主席 ， 就 是 讓 梁君彥 議員 「 過 了 海 便 是 神仙 」 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
他 當然 樂意 。,Resultative,chinese
我 覺得 大家 剛才 問 的 問題 都 很 具體 。,Resultative,chinese
候選人 的 資格 以至 哪些 議員 合 資格 投票 ， 我們 都 未 能 釐清 。,Resultative,chinese
在 如此 混亂 、 粗疏 的 情況 下 進入 選舉 程序 ， 主席 ， 我 怕 你 背負 的 壓力 會 很 大 。,Resultative,chinese
因此 ， 我 希望 主席 你 能夠 耐心 聆聽 議員 的 意見 ， 然後 作出 裁決 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 在 一 種 如此 不 能 服眾 的 情況 下 進行 立法會 主席 選舉 ， 香港 人 是 會 看 到 的 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
謝謝 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 對於 你 剛才 所 說 ， 「 祇有 立法會 主席 才 有 居留權 限制 ， 候選人 沒有 」 ， 我 完全 不 能 接受 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 我們 這 一 刻 進行 投票 ， 當選者 下 一 刻 便 成為 立法會 主席 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
因此 ， 我們 絕對 有 義務 釐清 他 已 完成 所有 放棄 英國 居留權 的 手續 ， 並且 交 出 正本 ， 以 正 視聽 。,Resultative,chinese
立法會 秘書處 亦 有 責任 維護 這個 程序 正確 和 完整 地 進行 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 ， 如果 梁君彥 議員 仍然 無法 交 出 蓋 有 正規 印章 的 信件 正本 ， 他 應該 不 符合 參選 資格 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
除了 設置 兩 個 投票箱 ， 分別 供 投 廢票 和 投 給 塗謹申 議員 ， 我們 是 否 還 要 為 梁君彥 議員 設置 投票箱 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
這 相當 影響 未來 立法會 任期 內 會議 如何 進行 ， 跟 全 港 公眾 利益 也 有 莫大 關係 。,Resultative,chinese
我 認為 這 一 刻 一定 要 處理 這 件 事 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 梁君彥 議員 無法 交 出 文件 正本 ， 他 應該 不 符合 參選 資格 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
我 剛才 祇 是 依書直說 ， 向 大家 引述 《 基本法 》 的 內容 ， 並 沒有 加入 個人 意見 。,Resultative,chinese
由於 主席 不 應 加入 個人 意見 ， 況且 當中 涉及 憲制 和 法律 的 問題 ， 我 不 宜 給予 任何 意見 。,Resultative,chinese
即使 我 提 出 意見 ， 也 未必 是 最 正確 無誤 。,Resultative,chinese
祇 供 大家 參考 而已 。,Resultative,chinese
任何 一 項 選舉 ， 不論 是 我 以往 參加 過 的 學生會 選舉 ， 以至 今 天 立法會 主席 的 選舉 ……,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 如果 這 是 正式 會議 ， 梁頌恒 議員 沒有 資格 參加 這個 會議 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
主席 ， 那麼 我 修正 我 第一 個 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
我 想 問 我 現在 究竟 有 沒 有 權 參加 這個 會議 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
主席 ， 根據 《 議事 規則 》 和 相關 法例 ， 任何 未 宣誓 的 議員 不 能 參加 正式 會議 和 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 那麼 我 下 一 個 問題 來 了 。,Resultative,chinese
《 議事 規則 》 第十二 條 《 每 屆 任期 的 首 次 會議 》 訂 明 ……,Resultative,chinese
（ 一 ） 在 立法會 每 屆 任期 首 次 會議 上 ， 議員 須 按照 本 議事 規則 第一 條 《 宗教 式 或 非宗教 式 宣誓 》 的 規定 作 宗教 式 或 非宗教 式 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
（ 二 ） 在 所有 出席 會議 的 議員 …… 「 ── 包括 我 ── 」 作 宗教 式 或 非宗教 式 宣誓 後 ， 須 按照 本 議事 規則 第四 條 《 立法會 主席 的 選擧 》 規定 的 程序 進行 立法會 主席 的 選擧 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 這裏 涉及 先後 次序 的 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 尚 未 完成 第一 款 的 程序 ， 即 所有 出席 這 次 會議 的 議員 進行 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
試問 怎 能 進入 第二 款 選舉 立法會 主席 的 程序 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
這 是 很 嚴重 的 規程 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
既然 我 已 容許 其他 議員 就座 ， 便 不 會 作出 不 容許 議員 發言 的 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
我 會 讓 他 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 如果 你 確認 這 是 一 個 正式 會議 ， 你 這樣 做 嚴重 違反 了 《 議事 規則 》 第一 條 的 規定 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
我 希望 你 重新 考慮 。,Resultative,chinese
我 認為 要 改選 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
我 和應 謝偉俊 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
他 不 稱職 。,Resultative,chinese
要 改選 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
你 可以 提出 質疑 ， 但 我 已 作 了 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
在席 議員 是 經過 選舉 確認 的 議員 ， 雖然 他 未 宣誓 ， 但 我 會 容許 他 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
你 可以 有 你 的 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 想 知道 ， 你 的 決定 是否 建基於 你 認為 有關 議員 是否 應該 正式 宣誓 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
如果 你 認為 他 的 宣誓 有效 而 准許 他 發言 ， 你 可 以 此 為 基礎 作出 決定 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
但 如果 你 同意 有關 宣誓 不 合理 和 不 合法 ， 你 這樣 做 便 嚴重 違反 了 《 議事 規則 》 第一 條 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
即使 任何 議員 未曾 作 最後 宣誓 ， 他 仍 具 議員 的 資格 ， 這 是 就 其 身份 而 言 。,Resultative,chinese
當然 ， 你 可以 說 他 尚 未 宣誓 ， 尚 未 是 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
但 問題 是 你 剛才 尚 未 宣誓 ， 我 已 容許 你 就座 。,Resultative,chinese
你 又 如何 解釋 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
主席 ， 當 你 宣佈 進入 選舉 主席 的 第二 階段 ， 便 已 確認 完成 了 第一 階段 的 宣誓 儀式 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 ， 你 不 要 搞 錯 這個 邏輯 。,Resultative,chinese
你 說 得 對 。,Resultative,chinese
不過 問題 在於 尚 未 有 人 取消 他 的 資格 ， 他 是 未 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
你 先前 在 會議 上 就座 ， 沒 有 人 取消 你 的 資格 ， 所以 你 有 資格 宣誓 。,Resultative,chinese
我 是 指 他 發言 ， 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
不 是 取消 資格 。,Resultative,chinese
這 是 下 一 步 會 處理 的 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
我 祇 是 提出 ， 議員 要 完成 第一 階段 的 宣誓 ， 才 有 資格 進入 第二 階段 參與 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
你 可以 質疑 我 的 做法 。,Resultative,chinese
但 我 認為 按照 剛才 的 程序 ， 你們 尚未 宣誓 已 有 資格 在 會議廳 就座 ， 我 是 基於 這個 理念 作出 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
你 問 我 理據 是 甚麼 ， 我 已 向 你 作出 解釋 。,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
無論 你 接受 與 否 ， 又 或 我 的 決定 是 對 或 錯 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 你 仍 視 我 為 主席 ， 並 稱呼 我 為 主席 ， 你 便 要 接受 我 的 決定 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
除非 你 不 把 我 當作 主席 ， 那 就 不用 理會 我 這 決定 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
梁頌恒 議員 ， 你 是否 要 繼續 發言 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
主席 ， 我 明白 你 不 想 當 「 醜人 」 ， 但 你 不 可以 違反 《 議事 規則 》 。,Resultative,chinese
《 議事 規則 》 第一 條 訂明 ， 議員 未 宣誓 便 不 能 參與 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
你 可以 提出 質疑 ， 但 我 剛才 已 作出 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
你 沒有 權 overrule 《 議事 規則 》 作出 這 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
你 根本 沒 有 power 作出 這 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
我 已 說 了 。,Resultative,chinese
我 的 決定 可以 是 錯 或 對 。,Resultative,chinese
但 無論 如何 ， 我 今天 不 會 跟 你 爭論 。,Resultative,chinese
這 是 錯 的 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
你 是否 要 作出 違反 《 議事 規則 》 的 決定 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
我 已 作出 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
如果 你 不 同意 我 的 決定 ， 可以 向 法庭 提出 質疑 。,Conditional-NeutralEpistemic,chinese
為何 你 這些 話 不 跟 他們 說 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
為何 你 不 叫 他們 向 法庭 提出 要 執行 你 的 決定 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
我 不 是 已 決定 了 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
為何 你 這些 話 祇 對 我 說 ， 卻 不 對 你 身旁 的 人 說 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
我 已經 作出 決定 ， 讓 他 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
梁耀忠 ， 為何 要 這樣 呢 ？,Interrogative-WHInfo-Direct,chinese
你 可否 保持 中立 和 公正 ， 按照 《 議事 規則 》 來 辦事 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
我 知道 你 不 會 當 「 醜人 」 ， 也 不 想 為難 你 。,Resultative,chinese
你 祇 需 按照 《 議事 規則 》 便 可以 。,Resultative,chinese
根據 《 議事 規則 》 ， 我 作 的 決定 便 是 最終 決定 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 規程 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
請 大家 先 坐 下 。,Resultative,chinese
規程 問題 ： 主席 ， 立法會 是 莊嚴 的 地方 。,Resultative,chinese
希望 你 請 那些 在 你 身旁 的 議員 返回 座位 。,Resultative,chinese
請 大家 坐 下 ， 並 保持 肅靜 。,Resultative,chinese
梁美芬 議員 ， 我 還 未 批准 你 發言 ， 請 坐 下 。,Resultative,chinese
我 不 是 插隊 發言 ， 主席 。,Resultative,chinese
我 希望 在 你 身旁 的 議員 可以 返回 座位 ， 因為 我們 感到 很 騷擾 。,Resultative,chinese
我們 希望 主席 你 一 個 人 主持 會議 。,Resultative,chinese
不 應 有 五 個 人 垂簾聽政 。,Resultative,chinese
你 不 需要 這些 人 來 保護 ， 對 嗎 ？,Interrogative-Polar-Direct,chinese
梁美芬 教授 ……,Resultative,chinese
…… 我們 感到 非常 騷擾 。,Resultative,chinese
我 希望 主席 裁決 。,Resultative,chinese
請 這 五 位 議員 返回 座位 ， 因為 立法會 《 議事 規則 》 ……,Resultative,chinese
剛才 的 會議 本來 進行 得 很 好 ……,Resultative,chinese
…… 第四十二 條 清楚 訂 明 ……,Resultative,chinese
…… 祇 是 你們 提出 這些 問題 ， 會議 便 不 能 進行 。,Resultative,chinese
…… 主席 ， 我 希望 你 要求 那 五 位 議員 返回 座位 ……,Resultative,chinese
梁美芬 議員 ， 我 還 未 叫喚 你 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
請 你 先 坐 下 。,Resultative,chinese
下 一 位 是 陳志全 議員 。,Resultative,chinese
梁頌恒 議員 尚 未 說 完 。,Resultative,chinese
梁頌恒 議員 ， 你 剛才 坐 下來 。,Resultative,chinese
我 以為 你 已 發言 完畢 。,Resultative,chinese
請 你 繼續 。,Resultative,chinese
主席 ， 我 忘記 說 到 哪里 。,Resultative,chinese
剛才 較為 混亂 。,Resultative,chinese
其實 ， 在 選舉 中 ……,Resultative,chinese
請 議員 坐 下 。,Resultative,chinese
在 我 叫喚 議員 發言 前 ， 請 先 坐 下 。,Resultative,chinese
梁頌恒 議員 ， 請 繼續 發言 。,Resultative,chinese
在 任何 選舉 中 ， 最 重要 的 兩 點 就 是 候選人 資格 及 選民 基礎 。,Resultative,chinese
現在 出現 了 兩 個 問題 。,Resultative,chinese
第一 ， 候選人 的 資格 成疑 。,Resultative,chinese
剛才 多 位 議員 已 說 過 這 點 ， 我 不 詳述 。,Resultative,chinese
第二 個 問題 是 關於 投票人 的 資格 ， 《 議事 規則 》 訂 明 的 上 一 項 程序 根本 未 完成 。,Resultative,chinese
如何 開始 下 一 步 選舉 主席 的 會議 ？,Interrogative-Reduced,chinese
《 議事 規則 》 已 清楚 訂 明 由 議員 宣誓 至 選舉 主席 的 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
在 第十二 條 （ 每 屆 任期 的 首 次 會議 ） 已 有 明確 規定 。,Resultative,chinese
所以 ， 主席 ， 請 你 先 看看 《 議事 規則 》 ， 以 決定 各 事項 的 先後 次序 。,Resultative,chinese
應該 讓 每 位 出席 會議 的 議員 作 出 宗教 式 或 非宗教 式 宣誓 後 ， 再 按照 《 議事 規則 》 第四 條 進行 選舉 主席 的 程序 。,Resultative,chinese
