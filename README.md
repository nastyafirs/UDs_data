# Methods of Analysis of Typologically Related Constructions Based on Multilingual Corpora

This repository contains the code, data, and metrics for experiments comparing a **rule-based method** and an **XLM-RoBERTa-based approach** for analysis of typologically related constructions. The experiments utilize **UCxn annotations (gold standard)** and **UD (Universal Dependencies) annotations** as input data.  

### Data  
- **UCxn annotations** – Folder containing Gold-standard annotations used for evaluation  
- **UD annotations** – Folder containing input data used for the experiments 

### Code  
- **ML&UDs.ipynb** – Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the **XLM-RoBERTa model** for construction prediction
- **Rule_based_method&UDs.ipynb** – Jupyter notebook with the **rule-based method** for construction prediction

### Predictions  
- **ml_construction_predictions.csv** – Predictions generated by the XLM-RoBERTa model
- **rb_ud_constructions.csv** – Predictions generated by the rule-based method 

### Evaluation Metrics  
- **ml_evaluation_metrics.csv** – Performance metrics for the XLM-RoBERTa model  
- **rb_evaluation_metrics.csv** – Performance metrics for the rule-based method 

## Usage  
Run the notebooks (`ML&UDs.ipynb` and `Rule_based_method&UDs.ipynb`) to reproduce the experiments
